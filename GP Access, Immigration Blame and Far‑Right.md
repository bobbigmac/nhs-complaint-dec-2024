# GP Access, Immigration Blame & Far‑Right Messaging — Evidence Pack
*(Prepared for meeting on 12 November)* - Robert (Bob) Davies: admin@bobbigmac.com

People — especially tougher‑immigration cohorts — commonly believe immigration makes it harder to get a GP appointment, and far‑right actors amplify that grievance. For delivery, treat belief as the driver: undercut it by making booking a GP appointment simple, fair and easy.

## Practical implication — fix access to undercut scapegoating

* Offer three clear choices at first contact: **web form/nhs app**, **phone call‑back for a short clinical chat**, or **book an in‑person slot**, even if just for triage to accommodate people without gatekeeping/judging them. 
* Keep a **24/7 request route** open (no instant response implied); show the next step and response window.
* Enable **future‑dated booking** (e.g., 1–6 weeks ahead, for anyone not technically inclined). I'd rather know I have an appointment in a month, than have no idea if I'll have an appointment today.
* Provide a **no‑phonecall path** (in-person/email/SMS/portal flow) and a **front‑desk option** for walk‑ins.
* Show **live status + receipt**, let patients re‑read messages; avoid forcing single sign‑on where not required, and always offer a non‑login route (NHS tech should support this, as eConsult and the NHS SMS system does this well enough once you're actually in it).
* **Reception standards:** courtesy baseline, and a clear route to report rudeness without blocking care.

This doesn't require anything more than most businesses manage by default, but NHS rules make the bare minimum feel like a lot to staff, because of all the extra dependency/complexity steps embedded in many processes.

Make GP booking easy and fair to remove the grievance that far‑right narratives feed on. It helps bring the people at the frayed edges back into systems that help them, instead of driving them deeper into despair.
