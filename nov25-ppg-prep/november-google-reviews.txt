I’m really disappointed with the service at New Bank Health Centre in Stockport road.
The customer service has been consistently poor, and the receptionist in particular has been very unprofessional during my visits.
This was my third time coming in for an appointment, only to be told yet again that it had been cancelled. No prior notice, no apology, and no effort to help rearrange things in a way that was actually convenient.
I understand things can happen, but the lack of communication and respect for patients’ time is extremely frustrating. Based on my experience so far, I can’t recommend this GP service

the new set up on online appointment is not user friendly and could be a barrier to people with some disabilities. the reception staff are rude and condescending.

Shocking patient service. Horrifyingly rude receptionists - they speak to you in a demeaning and condescending way and don’t bother to let you complete your sentence before cutting you off. Over the phone is a lot worse - because you’re not physically in front of them they think it gives them the right to speak to you like you’re a 2nd class citizen, absolutely backwards behaviour. Who will teach them some manners in dealing with patients? I manage in hospitality and let me just say - if my guests were dealt with the way your receptionists treat me (and others looking at these reviews), they’d receive disciplinary action straight away.

I changed over to New bank a few years ago,I thought it was the best thing I every done,I got to see doctors karan macclay was me GP who was great she got things moving with my health conditions. I was happy untill the message came, one day say new bank was being taking over by a new company. I have been twice to centre and both times the have sent me, to the AE spending 12 hours in waiting, to be sent home. What a joke!! I'm also getting my tablets missed off my monthly tables I never had this problem before. So this is why I've change my riew on newbank.

The worst GP ever, anytime you book an appointment they ask you for pictures of your issue, like some issue are private you need to discuss with the doctor privately, if you can’t book an face to face appointment what’s the point of you have ing a GP? and if they ever give you an appointment face to face, the doctors don’t even listen to you properly it’s like they just can’t be arsed with their job, if you tell the doctor that you feel a certain way about a condition you got, and you think it’s a certain thing causing it they say yes this is it your right, so it makes you feel like their not even trying to look at your problem, whatever you say they say that’s it, it’s the same issue with all the doctors here, the worst GP ever been here for 3 years had enough, at times when you book an appointment even early in the morning, they don’t listen to you or reply back they just ignore you, until you call them back and they don’t even pick up the call and act like their busy
