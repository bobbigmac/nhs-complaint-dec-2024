# New Bank Health Centre – PPG Meeting Notes
*(Prepared for meeting on 10 September)* - Robert (Bob) Davies: admin@bobbigmac.com

## A. Background Information Request (sent 26 August)   
**I Emailed GTD Healthcare – awaiting reply**  
- **Management Tenure**: Requested dates when GTD formally assumed responsibility for each practice.  
- **Continuity of Staff**: Asked whether admin/reception staff were retained or replaced at handover.  
- **Patient Feedback Handling**: Queried whether GTD reviews online patient feedback (Google, NHS website) and uses it for improvement.  
- **Practice Performance Transparency**: Asked if GTD shares satisfaction data publicly. Noted that the only example found was “You said, we did (May 19)” (dated before 2022). Asked if updated versions exist.  
- **Patient Access Standards**: Asked whether GTD has a standard access policy (e.g. wait time targets) applied across all practices.  

## B. Appointment System Issues

A small addition was noticed to the appointment form, it otherwise still has all its usual problems.

1. **Conflicting information on “same day” vs “within 1 working day”**  
   - Front page says: *“We offer a same day appointment service …”*  
   - Next page says: *“We will respond within 1 working day during opening times.”*  
   - Next page also says: *“Complete this form before 4pm … It’s ok to complete this form the night before.”*  
   - **Unclear**: Is it same day or next day? Do you fill in the form the day before, by 4pm, or before 8am or by a 'designated time' (as some reviews suggest)? Why is there a timelineness component to this at all? Should be simple: 
    - Submit request (necessary for 'triage' in supposed 'efficiency' push)
    - Get response (text if phone, email if no phone) offering (or even just informing) a date/time, and appointment type (call, video, in-person)
    - Accept appointment, occurs at agreed time by arranged method.

2. **Appointment request form design**  
   - Fields are repetitive and poorly designed, leading to duplication or lost info:  
     - “About the problem” (textarea) 
     - “How long has this been a problem?” (textbox)  
     - “Ideas about the cause” (textarea)  
     - “What are the concerns?” (textarea)  
     - “How would you like the doctor/nurse to help?” (textarea)  
   - Recently added (I think): *“When would you be available today for a phone call or video appointment (if needed)?”* — a **marginal improvement** but still not a scheduled appointment. Still depends on 2 calls, then deletion.

3. **Contact details requirement**  
   - Both phone number **and** email address are required.  
   - Issue: excludes patients who only have one. *“Good luck if you don’t have one or the other.”*  

## C. Questions

- What system/vendor and policy currently drive request deletion after missed calls?

&nbsp;

- Can requests stay open with reschedule options instead of deletion?

&nbsp;

- How many failed calls are doctors making each day? How much time is being wasted on missed calls vs how much is being saved by this approach? How much patient time is being wasted filling in forms, and are repeated form entries with reduced information leaving doctors with insufficient information to act directly?
  - Is this model effective? How do you know?

&nbsp;

- What alternative access exists for patients with only phone or only email (or neither)?

&nbsp;

- The new NHS 10 Year Plan stresses "Analogue to Digital", but you don't seem to be able to get either right. What is the plan to adopt or integrate with better systems?

&nbsp;

- Would you consider trialling **old-school** "walk-in and make a scheduled appointment to come in and see a doctor" that doesn't require any tech whatsoever, even if it's just for one day a week and mainly focused on running triage in short slots, that can be followed-up on later?

&nbsp;

## D. Training Challenge

This is an important detail that might affect problem-solving approach at the practice.

- At the last meeting you referred to a **training challenge** in response to "competence" complaints, and I wanted to raise a training challenge for management...
  - Handout: A Diplomatic Training Challenge: _For Management_
  - Quick worksheet to provide guidance around separating training gaps from system issues and on identifying root causes and following-up with measurable/measured fixes.

## E. Recent Reviews (6 Aug – 10 Sept)   

- **Blood test cancellations** (Z) – appointment cancelled *four times*, told to go to MRI, receptionist hung up.  
- **Patient struck off** (Kenny J) – removed from practice after moving 400m, unable to get scan results.  
- **Broken promises & no call back** (Shadow S) – form submitted, told doctor would call same day, no call received, left unwell without antibiotics, had to take sick leave.  
- **Medication ordering problems** (Joyce Louis) – new NHS app process caused dangerous delays; blood test also cancelled.  
- **Severe reception staff mistreatment** (Javad Moazami) – ignored, mocked, shouted at, kicked out while in mental health crisis, left in tears, later struck off.  
- **General dysfunction** (Klaudia Kania) – called “The Worst GP in Manchester”; rude staff, broken systems, impossible appointment booking, calls for overhaul.  
- **Lack of compassion** (Maha Elmi, a month ago) – “No time for human been… very disappointed.” 

## F. Review Trends (overall)

- All practices operated by GTD Healthcare (except The Smithy Surgery Hyde at 3.9 stars) **barely rate above 2 stars on average**, with some **below 2 stars**.  
- I don’t yet have a full set of reviews gathered, as I’m waiting on confirmation of takeover dates. 
- I will only collate reviews for the correct periods once I have those dates.  
- However, this **general trend is important to acknowledge** and should be raised in the meeting. 
- Key question: Does GTD **accept that these low ratings are representative**, and what steps are they taking to improve?

## Google Reviews - In Detail (6 Aug – 10 Sept)

### 1. Z ⭐ 1/5  

They cancelled a blood test appointment for my dad 4 times and then on the 4th cancellation were told to go to MRI for a routine blood test! No explanation given as to why and the receptionist put the phone down on us!

### 2. Kenny J ⭐ 1/5

### 3. Shadow S ⭐ 1/5  

**This practice is one of the worst practices going.** It USED TO BE good, offering same day appointments as stated on their website as long as we fill in the form within the designated time. But now it’s going downhill and after reading other reviews and realising I’m not the only one it’s made me feel even more frustrated. I filled a form in a couple weeks ago and I called up to make sure they’re received my form and they’ll be offering me an appointment the same day. **The receptionist told me the doctor has received my form and will definitely call me back that same day. I waited and waited**, I was so ill I fell asleep and when I woke up I realised they’re closed, **I double checked my call logs and I didn’t receive a single call**. This has happened to me before where I’ve been ignored by them which is why I called up this time to make sure they’ll definitely call me back. **The receptionist falsely reassured me that the doctor would “definitely” call me back that same day.** I felt I had an infection and needed antibiotics but they didn’t even bother. I needed an emergency appointment. I waited another day thinking they might’ve been busy but still no call back, I ended up getting better on my own without any support from the gp. I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.  

I’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and **I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is** and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. **This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.**

### 4. Joyce Louis ⭐ 1/5  

**I'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery.** I had a blood test scheduled but was given a date I couldn’t attend. **When I managed to make time, the appointment was cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances."** 

The new system for ordering medication is also a step backward. It was previously simple to order through the pharmacy app, but now it's linked to the NHS app, which requires identity verification. Despite submitting my details, I'm told it will take several days for confirmation—followed by additional delays for dispensing and delivery. This puts me at risk of running out of essential medication, which is unacceptable.  
**This level of service is deeply concerning.** I will be looking to move to a more reliable GP surgery.*

### 5. Javad Moazami ⭐ 1/5  

**Unfortunately, my experience at this clinic was very unpleasant. The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful.** On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.  

When I encountered **disrespectful and insulting behavior**, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.  

I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. **They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.** The staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, **she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress**.  

After being kicked out of the clinic, **I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless**. I was in a mental health crisis, and **the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day.** The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.  

Eventually, **I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.** No one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.*

### 6. Klaudia Kania ⭐ 1/5  

**The Worst GP in Manchester!**

I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and **I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated**. **The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.**  

**Trying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration.** **You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions;* and still end up with no appointment.** It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.  

Terrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.

**No time for human been... very disappointed**
