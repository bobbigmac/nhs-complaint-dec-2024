They are open from 8am to hardly 10am or 11am. Who makes them think that we are available during those times when someone is sick or at work or commuting?? Instead of making it easy for sick patients to book appointments and requests at their convenience, they stress you out more, make you more anxious and sick. Horrible management! In Liverpool and London, almost all GPs have open appointment systems, you can book appointments online and choose your date and time. Admin requests, medical reports and sick notes are processed within 48 hours no questions asked and they even deliver medication to your house! But look at these guys, they are operating on biblical systems and it is 2025!! Do yourselves a favour and please open up your booking systems. Its not that hard. Stop being so shameless! I will be reporting this GP to Health Ombudsman, NHS and MP. ❤️🙏7",

Please let me reassure you that is not the case, and although you may not see it, our team constantly go above and beyond behind the scenes to try and make improvements for patients. This includes extending opening hours at a sister site so more patients are able to be seen each day, introducing new services like a full wellbeing team, physio team and in-house pharmacists that most practices don’t have, and having a same day service so patients don’t have to wait weeks to be seen. It's a shame you have decided to leave our practice, but I am glad that you feel you’re getting better care elsewhere. Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer",
