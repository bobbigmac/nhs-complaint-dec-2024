They cancelled a blood test appointment for my dad 4 times and then on the 4th cancellation were told to go to MRI for a routine blood test! No explanation given as to why and the receptionist put the phone down on us!

This practice is one of the worst practices going. It USED TO BE good, offering same day appointments as stated on their website as long as we fill in the form within the designated time. But now it’s going downhill and after reading other reviews and realising I’m not the only one it’s made me feel even more frustrated. I filled a form in a couple weeks ago and I called up to make sure they’re received my form and they’ll be offering me an appointment the same day. The receptionist told me the doctor has received my form and will definitely call me back that same day. I waited and waited, I was so ill I fell asleep and when I woke up I realised they’re closed, I double checked my call logs and I didn’t receive a single call. This has happened to me before where I’ve been ignored by them which is why I called up this time to make sure they’ll definitely call me back. The receptionist falsely reassured me that the doctor would “definitely” call me back that same day. I felt I had an infection and needed antibiotics but they didn’t even bother. I needed an emergency appointment. I waited another day thinking they might’ve been busy but still no call back, I ended up getting better on my own without any support from the gp. I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.

I’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.

I'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery. I had a blood test scheduled but was given a date I couldn’t attend. When I managed to make time, the appointment was cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances."

The new system for ordering medication is also a step backward. It was previously simple to order through the pharmacy app, but now it's linked to the NHS app, which requires identity verification. Despite submitting my details, I'm told it will take several days for confirmation—followed by additional delays for dispensing and delivery. This puts me at risk of running out of essential medication, which is unacceptable.

This level of service is deeply concerning. I will be looking to move to a more reliable GP surgery.

Rating: 1/5 - Extremely DisappointingService

Unfortunately, my experience at this clinic was very unpleasant. The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful. On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.

When I encountered disrespectful and insulting behavior, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.
After sharing this review, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) to find that several others had similar experiences at this clinic. Given how often such stories seem to come up, it might be worth taking a closer look—not just for me, but for others who may be facing similar situations.

In fact, what I’m about to describe is only one of several upsetting experiences I’ve had at this clinic—and sadly, not the last.

I am not sure whether this was racially motivated, but the way I was treated was deeply inhumane. I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.

At that very moment, I briefly saw my doctor through a door behind one of the senior staff members—she appeared to say something to someone at a desk and then turned back and disappeared. Still, the staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress.

After being kicked out of the clinic, I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless. I was in a mental health crisis, and the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day. The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.

And this wasn’t the only time I was treated poorly. I had endured other incidents of disrespect and mistreatment before, but I didn’t know who to turn to or how to raise my concerns. So I kept silent. Eventually, I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.

No one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.

The Worst GP in Manchester!

I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.

Trying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.

Terrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.
