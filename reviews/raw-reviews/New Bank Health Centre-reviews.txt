Hopeless, they delete appointment requests, I've submitted 4 and still haven't been able to see a doctor. Had hoped it would improve under new management, but nope, still incompetent. I sent a detailed complaint about it last year and still no change. Passive aggressive staff replying to reviews blaming people and a doctor posting their own review lying about how great they are is just the tip of the iceberg. Over forty reviews here complaining about exactly the same problems, with no action from the practice.

The Worst GP in Manchester!

I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.

Trying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.

Terrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.

If I could give zero stars, I would! This GP is so shameless, that they have now even time-limited sending admin requests and sick notes as well. Just like the appointments. They are open from 8am to hardly 10am or 11am. Who makes them think that we are available during those times when someone is sick or at work or commuting?? Instead of making it easy for sick patients to book appointments and requests at their convenience, they stress you out more, make you more anxious and sick. Horrible management!

In Liverpool and London, almost all GPs have open appointment systems, you can book appointments online and choose your date and time. Admin requests, medical reports and sick notes are processed within 48 hours no questions asked and they even deliver medication to your house! But look at these guys, they are operating on biblical systems and it is 2025!!

Do yourselves a favour and please open up your booking systems. Its not that hard. Stop being so shameless! I will be reporting this GP to Health Ombudsman, NHS and MP.

Hi Jayne, thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear you had a negative experience with us here at New Bank Health Centre.
We do encourage patients who are able to use the internet to visit our website to fill in an online form. However, if a patient is unable to do so, we will fill in the form for them over the phone. Our reception team aren't able to book appointments and the online forms get assigned to the appropriate clinician. Unfortunately, our appointments are booked incredibly quickly, usually within the first few hours of the day, so if patients submit forms later on in the afternoon, it is unlikely we will be able to give them an appointment. We are a same day service and are unable to book appointments in advance.
I’m afraid due to confidentiality laws, I am unable to respond on here to specific parts of your complaint. To do so would breach your medical confidentiality. If you would like me to look further into this incident for you, please do fill in a feedback form. You can the feedback form on our website here: https://bit.ly/3PAm4je
We thank you for your feedback on our website. We are continually making improvements to make it easier for patients to use. If you are unable to remember your password, you should be able to reset your password using a link that will be located in one of our emails.

Hello Moe. Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear you feel we are unprofessional. We feel patients should have control of their health and do encourage patients to manage their own care; this includes chasing your test results and submitting your own repeat prescriptions. We find this gives our doctors and nurses more time to see or speak to patients and to help them when they're feeling unwell. I am very concerned about your statement that we systematically discriminate you because of your disability. We pride ourselves on treating every patient equally so I would really like to investigate this point further. If you would be happy for me to take a look into your case, please submit a feedback form here https://bit.ly/3NdiJ6P. Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer

Hello Farah, thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that you feel we're an awful GP practice, and were struggling yesterday to get treatment from one of our doctors.
Usually, we would only direct patients to use the services of a walk-in centre or NHS 111 if we did not have any appointments left and a patient felt like they needed to be seen that day. If they could wait, we would usually ask them to contact us the following day to book an appointment.
I haven't been able to look into this for you as I can't find you under the name used on your review in our system. I would like to investigate this further to find out what happened yesterday and to see what went wrong. If you would like me to do that, please fill in a feedback form here: https://bit.ly/3AMLAvw

Hello Satvinder, thank you for your review. We’re saddened to hear you feel we’re a terrible GP Practice and that our staff “don’t want to work.” Please let me assure you that’s not the case.

I apologise for taking a bit more time than usual to respond to your review. I did want to take a look into what happened so I can offer further information for you.

I can completely understand your frustration about being passed over to pharmacy and not being given a GP appointment. However, we are obliged to use the Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme (CPCS) mentioned in your review. The Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme is a new national service to facilitate patients having a same day appointment for minor illnesses, or to get an urgent supply of a repeat medication.

The service is designed to help alleviate pressure on GP appointments and emergency departments and so more people are able to get treatment quickly. I understand you may feel that the doctors here at New Bank Health Centre are avoiding patients, but please let me reassure you that is not the case. This is a scheme that has been put in place by the Government, and we have been instructed to use it by both the Government and NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care, our governing body.

Only specific pharmacies are involved in this scheme. This is why when you contacted Cohen’s pharmacy they said they were not responsible and when you visited them, they charged you for medication. Unfortunately, due to this being a public forum, I’m unable to give more details as it would breach confidentiality rules.

Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer

Hello Abz, thank you for your review. When it comes to the telephone, it is a first come first served system and unfortunately, we cannot control how many people call the surgery and how long the wait will be on the phone. Our team strive to get through the calls as quickly as possible, but sometimes the wait for patients will still be longer than everyone would like.
It's a shame you feel that your tax money is being used for useless clinics and doctors. We feel we're a vital asset within the community and always help patients the best way we can and as quickly as we can. We try to accommodate everyone and give every patient who needs it an appointment, but we do have a limit that is very often reached from early in the morning - this includes emergency appointments. With that being said, I would be happy to take a look into this situation for you, and to get to the bottom of exactly what was said and why you weren't given an appointment that day. If you would like me to do that, please do fill in a feedback form here: https://bit.ly/3yN8b9s. Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer

Hello Amina, I’m sorry to hear that your experience with our practice has not been great and you feel that our surgery should be shut down.
Here at New Bank Health Centre, we operate a telephone triage policy. That means that every patient will get a telephone consultation first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you or your son have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation. This is a nationally accepted way of working that many other practices in the UK use.
We offer in-person blood test appointments at the practice every working day of the week. The only time we would offer appointments for patients at a different practice, would be if a patient isn’t able to attend during normal surgery hours, or if the next appointment that was available was in our Enhanced Access hours (6-8pm Monday – Friday and 9am-5pm on Saturdays at The Robert Darbishire Practice) so I am afraid I have to disagree with your point that we always send patients to other practices.
I am however very concerned about your son not being able to get his vaccinations and would like to look into this further for you. If you would like me to do that, please fill in a feedback form on our website. You can find it here: https://bit.ly/3nKUoOJ

Hello Lukasz. Thank you for your review. We're sad that you feel you have had a bad experience with us here at New Bank Health Centre. Our reception team are trained to triage patient requests so they can make sure you get the correct help you need. We understand it may be frustrating to let them know your problem, but giving them this information will help them to assign your query to the right clinician or to deal with your issue efficiently. No requests that patients submit should be ignored, however, there are circumstances where a GP does not need to be involved.

Hi Chenor, thank you for taking the time to post your review.
I’m sorry you feel like you struggle to get in touch with us. We do try to make sure we’re prompt when patients contact us either through our website or over the telephone.
We do prescribe many medications here at New Bank Health Centre, although there are some medicines that do need to be prescribed through a consultant at a hospital. When we feel that a patients problem needs further investigation, we will refer them to a specialist to ensure they get the proper care they need. I appreciate this can be a longer process, although it is to make sure that the treatment they receive is appropriate for them.

Hello Pargat. Thank you for your review. We’re sorry to hear about the miscommunication you had recently with our practice.
We understand that we do function a little bit differently here at New Bank Health Centre by operating a telephone triage system. This telephone triage system means that all patients will receive a phone call first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. Having a telephone consultation first should have been communicated with you when you were given an appointment. If it wasn’t then we do apologise.
Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer

Unfortunately it's the closet GP in my area - really unprofessional and rude receptionists is what drags my rating down for them. Never had a problem with any of the doctors.

Hello. We're sorry that you feel New Bank Health Centre is the worst GP in the UK and that the staff there are rude. We do always try our best to provide the best service and the highest level of care to patients that we possibly can.
We appreciate that being prescribed the wrong medicine can be frustrating, we do hope that you have now managed to get the correct prescription.
Unfortunately, the NHS is very stretched at the moment, and there are a lot of patients in the community that need our care. Because of this we do have strict appointment times we need to stick to and running over those appointment times would cause delays for other patients. If your appointment lasted the full duration, this may have been why Dr Singh did not have time to answer your questions. If that was not the case, and you would like me to look further into your recent experiences with us, please do let me know by filling out a feedback form here: https://bit.ly/3Fof8Ae

Hello George. Thank you for your review, we appreciate any reviews we receive whether they be positive or negative.
We do understand that not all patients have internet access. That is why we have policies in place to offer further support to those who are digitally excluded, like taking appointment requests over the telephone etc.
We appreciate that we do function a little bit differently here at New Bank Health Centre by operating a telephone triage system. This telephone triage system means that all patients will receive a phone call first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation.
If you feel like you can no longer be a patient at our practice we do understand. To find a new GP practice, simply visit the NHS website. There you can search for a GP surgery using your postcode.

Hello Al. Thank you for your review.
Here at New Bank Health Centre, we do operate a telephone triage system, where each patient will receive a telephone call. If the patient does not pick up on the first call, our policy is that the clinician will try them again no earlier than ten minutes later. If the patient still does not pick up, they will be asked to re-book an appointment for the following day. Whilst we understand your frustration, our practice has hundreds of patients who need our help each and every day, and we are not able to continuously call patients until they pick up.
The only other circumstance that we allow our team to put the phone down on a patient is if they are being verbally abusive or aggressive. If none of these scenarios fit with your experience please do let me know by filling out a feedback form on our website and I will happily look into this for you.

Hello Carole, thank you for your review. I’m saddened to hear that you feel members of our team discriminate against your mental health and that our receptionists hold our doctors to ransom.
We care greatly about patients mental health and believe that looking after mental health is just as important and looking after physical health. That’s why our staff members are trained in mental health, and we also have dedicated mental health practitioners and a full wellbeing team in place to help patients.
Regarding our receptionists, we can assure you that they do not hold our doctors to ransom. Our reception team are highly trained to deal with and triage patient requests, so they are passed over to the correct clinician or staff member. This in turn makes sure that the request is dealt with appropriately, and that each medical professional has all the information they need before the appointment so they can spend all the time in the consultation helping them.

Hello Jordan.
Thank you for your review, I’m saddened to hear that you feel we’re the worst doctors in Longsight and that our staff don’t care at all. Please let me reassure you that is not the case, and although you may not see it, our team constantly go above and beyond behind the scenes to try and make improvements for patients. This includes extending opening hours at a sister site so more patients are able to be seen each day, introducing new services like a full wellbeing team, physio team and in-house pharmacists that most practices don’t have, and having a same day service so patients don’t have to wait weeks to be seen.
It's a shame you have decided to leave our practice, but I am glad that you feel you’re getting better care elsewhere.

Hello Einass. Thank you for your review. We're sad to hear you feel our service is very bad. We're passionate about helping our community with their health so it is disappointing that you don't feel we're reaching that goal.
We're always happy to take patient feedback on board. If you're looking to help us make improvements, the best way to do that is to join our Patient Participation Group. They are a group of people who are patients of the surgery and want to help it work as well as it can for patients, doctors and staff. They get together to bring different ideas to the surgery to help us treat patients better or to improve what we do in some way. If you would like to join our Patient Participation Group, fill out this form: https://bit.ly/3DJEGIZ
Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer
