# Re-framing patient feedback

#### You:
Just logging this for my thinking on this project...

Trying to figure out a new way to tell my doctor's surgery "doing it like this is stupid and alienates ~40% of your patients" because the last time I did that they said "all GP practices do it like this", and didn't seem to realise that that's precisely the problem.

I've given them all the receipts, and then some, but now they're moving to a new system, designed by a Manchester University AI researcher, that is exactly like the old system, but now it has AI in it. So I'm really not that optimistic about the patient experience improving.

The reviews for the new system are pretty good, but obviously this doesn't catch reviews from people offline who can't use these deep/complex online-only systems, I'm look at 18+ months wait for the NHS patient survey to catch some sample of the real outcomes :/ uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.p...

I went through every bit of documentation I could find, and aside from the constant spelling mistakes and terribly vague feature-naming, it also looks like the back-end software is designed by an AI researcher, that has probably never had a real product designer anywhere near it.

Also they're rolling this out to a dozen local practices, and they're convinced it's going to solve all their problems :/
I'm trying not to be hyper-negative, because I know it _could_ slightly improve the situation for _some_ patients, but holy shit, it's hard to not just shake some sense into them

#### ChatGPT:
I hear your frustration — and you’re right that when you tell the practice *“this is alienating \~40% of patients”* they often push back with *“everyone does it this way.”*

Here are some ways you could re-frame it so the point lands more clearly:

---

### 1. Anchor in their own data

Their **patient survey** already shows around **39–40% fail at the first step of contact** (phone, NHS App, or website)【13†PatientSurveyBreakdown.md】. You’re not guessing a number — it’s in black and white from their own patients.

👉 *“Your own survey shows that 4 in 10 patients can’t even get through to request care. That’s not a minority, that’s nearly half the community.”*

---

### 2. Show the system design is at fault

Multiple documents and reviews highlight:

- Digital-only booking blocks people without tech access【12†README.md】【16†ChatGPT-GP\_Appointment\_System\_Issues.md】
- Deleting requests after missed calls penalises patients unfairly【12†README.md】
- Calling missed unscheduled calls “missed appointments” misrepresents reality【16†ChatGPT-GP\_Appointment\_System\_Issues.md】

👉 *“This isn’t about patients failing — it’s about the system being set up in ways that predictably exclude large groups.”*

---

### 3. Emphasise it’s not unique to them, but still unacceptable

Yes, **many practices do the same**, but that’s not a defence. It just means the problem is **systemic**.

👉 *“Saying all practices do this doesn’t make it right. It means the same failure is being repeated everywhere, and you could be the first to actually fix it.”*

---

### 4. Translate “stupid system” into professional terms

Instead of “stupid,” frame it as:

- **Unsafe** (delays block timely care)
- **Inequitable** (vulnerable patients excluded)
- **Non-compliant** with NHS standards on access & communication【12†README.md】

---

### 5. Offer concrete alternatives

From the docs, you already have a menu of fixes:

- Don’t delete requests; allow rescheduling within 24–48 hours
- Offer **callback windows** instead of all-day waiting
- Allow phone/in-person booking for those excluded from digital【12†README.md】【15†meeting-prep-sept-10.md】

👉 *“Other models already in use elsewhere show this is solvable — without costing more staff time.”*

---

Would you like me to **draft a 2–3 sentence version** that you could drop into a PPG meeting or email — something short, neutral in tone, but still makes the “40% blocked at the door” point unavoidable?


#### You:
I keep fucking telling you. Callback windows is not good enough.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — thanks for spelling that out. You’ve been consistent: **“callback windows” is still waiting around, just in a smaller box.** It doesn’t give patients *certainty* or *control*.

From your own notes and the practice docs, the real ask is **proper scheduled appointments** — the same as any other service people rely on (dentist, hospital, even the hairdresser). Not “maybe today between 10–12,” but *“your call is booked for 11:20am, if you miss it you can reschedule.”*

That fits with the core problems raised:

- The current “we’ll ring twice and delete your request” is unsafe and unfair【12†README.md】【16†ChatGPT-GP\_Appointment\_System\_Issues.md】.
- NHS surveys show \~40% of patients fail at the first hurdle【13†PatientSurveyBreakdown.md】.
- Reviews show patients giving up because they don’t trust the system【15†meeting-prep-sept-10.md】【17†ChatGPT-Appointment\_service\_confusion.sourced.md】.

So instead of **callback windows**, the argument is:\
👉 *“Patients deserve a booked appointment time (whether phone, video, or face-to-face). That’s the only way to remove wasted waiting, uncertainty, and the unfair blame of calling a missed unscheduled call an ‘appointment.’”*

Do you want me to draft a **short talking point** you can use in meetings that cuts this down to one line? Something like: *“What patients need is actual booked appointments — not callback windows, not vague promises.”*


#### You:
Okay, My GP practice doesn't seem to understand that "everyone does it like this" is precisely why people so widely feel that the NHS is 'broken', it's not due to a lack of doctors, it's because of systemic failures and access issues like those described in this project. I've already gathered a lot of 'receipts' to demonstrate this failure for my specific practice (I am a patient, in the PPG, at New Bank Health Centre), but since they don't see it as a problem because "everyone does it like this", let's step back and look for ways to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, that a) everyone doing it like this IS a problem, and b) if GTD Healthcare want to stand out, they _could_ do it differently, use the new tech for the people who like it, _but crucially_ learn from the reviews and other feedback they are currently ignoring to be WAY better than their competition, by actually letting some of the old ways back in, like if an old person with a crappy phone, or a neurodivergent struggler, wants an appointment with zero digital interaction, GTD _CAN_ offer that, and be praised for it, improving access AND can then ask that person to review them, maybe even putting GTD-run practices ahead of all the other 1-2star practices up and down the country.

Outline this as a strategy for me, if their corpo-speak self-interest and hyper-focus on system-optimisation is what's causing most of the problems, let's use that to our advantage and sell them the sizzle on providing better access to patients, that doesn't rely  on shiny new toys.

#### ChatGPT:
Love this. Let’s sell them a strategy that speaks in their language (KPIs, complaints reduction, contract risk, CQC, optics) while actually fixing access for humans — including people who want **zero** digital.

# Strategy: “Category-Leading Access” for GTD (pilot at New Bank)

## Executive hook (what you’ll say)

**“If everyone does it this way and patients hate it, that’s the gap. GTD can win by being the first to make access genuinely equitable — keep the new tech for those who want it, but restore a no-tech route with *booked* appointment times and a ‘no deletion’ policy. That cuts repeat contact, lifts reviews, and lowers complaints — fast.”**\
(Their own docs and your notes show request **deletion after two failed calls**, and that \~**40%** of patients aren’t making it through the current system at the first step. That’s failure demand they’re paying for every day. fileciteturn1file0turn1file3)

---

## 1) Outcome targets (90 days)

- **Reduce first-contact failure** (couldn’t get through / request closed without care) from \~40% toward **≤20%**. fileciteturn1file3
- **Cut repeat contacts** (same issue within 7 days) by **30%**.
- **Raise public review score** by **+0.5★** through real fixes + active responses. (Recent reviews show access & comms failures you can flip into quick wins.) fileciteturn1file5turn1file12
- **Staff time reclaimed**: measure minutes saved per avoided re-submission/call-back loop.

**North-star:** fewer “we rang twice then deleted your request” events; more **booked** slots patients can trust. (Your prep notes flag deletion and unscheduled calls as the core pain. fileciteturn1file0)

---

## 2) Access model (how it works)

**Three equal doors, one shared book:**

1. **Online** (keep the new system for digital-keen patients).
2. **Phone** (care coordinators book directly into the same diary).
3. \*\*Walk-in to **book** (no form, no email, no app) — receptionist books a time, prints an appointment slip if needed.

**Non-negotiables**

- **Booked telephone times** (e.g., 11:20, not “we’ll ring sometime”).
- **No deletion on missed call**: keep request open 48h with **self-rebook** + SMS/IVR option; if safety risk, escalate. Your doc already argues deletion penalises patients and erodes trust. fileciteturn1file3
- **Reasonable adjustments policy at front desk** (elderly, neurodivergent, limited English, no smartphone): staff may **bypass digital** and **book immediately**.
- **Same clinical triage matrix**, different path to it: patients reach triage via any door; admin submits on behalf when needed. (Your notes show the form is long and duplicative — don’t force it on everyone.) fileciteturn1file0

Why this persuades them: it **shrinks failure demand** (re-submissions, chasing, angry calls) and **stabilises throughput** with predictable, scheduled contacts — not random call-backs that get missed and then deleted. fileciteturn1file3

---

## 3) Operational changes (cheap, fast)

- **Diary templates:** carve bookable **telephone** slot grids (e.g., 5–7 min) and **F2F** blocks per day; release in **tranches across all channels** so online doesn’t scoop everything.
- **Two-call rule → one call + SMS link**: after one missed ring, auto-SMS: “We tried to call — rebook here / call reception to book.” **Never** close a request silently. Your notes show silent closures are common. fileciteturn1file3
- **Front-desk script (no-tech)**
  > “Would you like a **booked** phone slot today/tomorrow, or a face-to-face? I can book it now — no online form needed.”
- **Admin-on-behalf**: reception can submit minimal triage info when helpful, but **booking a time** is the primary promise.
- **Website & IVR copy**: add a line above the fold — “No app? No problem. Call or come in to **book**.” (Your review extract shows confusion from mixed messages; remove it.) fileciteturn1file5turn1file12

---

## 4) Complaints & reputation (the “sizzle”)

- **“You said, we did”** monthly micro-poster + web tile (what changed this month: “no more deletion on missed calls”; “booked telephone times now available”).
- **Review capture from analogue users**: hand them a small “How was booking today?” card with QR **and** “Text YES/NO” option; staff can log comments verbatim if they consent.
- **Active responses** to Google/NHS reviews within **5 working days**; tag themes (access, comms, meds) and feed to a tiny monthly action huddle. (Your doc notes reviews being ignored or hard to access — fix that governance.) fileciteturn1file3

ROI pitch: better reviews → fewer escalations → less head-office fire-fighting; and it differentiates GTD from a sea of 1–2★ practices. (Your summary shows that’s the baseline in this portfolio, with a couple of brighter outliers.) fileciteturn1file18

---

## 5) Pilot plan at New Bank (6 weeks)

**Week 0–1: Setup**

- Agree policies (no deletion; booked times; analogue route).
- Build diary templates; set SMS templates; tweak IVR/website line.
- Huddle train reception (scripts + reasonable adjustments).

**Week 2–3: Go-live (soft)**

- Begin analogue booking + booked phone times.
- Start “no deletion” + SMS self-rebook.
- Baseline metrics: call abandonment, % closed without contact, repeat contacts, average time-to-first-response, review volume/sentiment.

**Week 4–6: Optimise**

- Adjust slot mix (F2F vs phone).
- Publish “You said, we did #1”.
- Share early wins with PCN/ICB and PPG.

Governance: weekly 30-min stand-up (Ops lead, GP lead, Reception lead, Patient rep) with a 1-page dashboard.

---

## 6) Metrics they’ll care about (and how you’ll show lift)

- **Access**: % requests **closed without contact**; **time-to-first-clinical decision**; **phone abandonment**; online form drop-off.
- **Quality**: re-contacts same problem ≤7 days; complaints volume; upheld complaint rate.
- **Reputation**: review score, response time, top 3 themes (pre vs post).
- **Productivity**: GP time in failed call attempts; admin time on duplicate forms; DNA rate for booked telephone (it will fall with precise times).\
  (Your evidence pack already documents where the pain sits: deletion, unscheduled calls, long complex forms, mixed messages. fileciteturn1file0turn1file3turn1file12)

---

## 7) Risk & mitigation

- **Demand spike** once word spreads: release routine slots in **daily tranches**; hold back a last-minute bucket for late presenters.
- **Perceived unfairness (“walk-ins queue-jump”)**: communicate one book shared by all doors; publish the rule.
- **Staff capacity**: short-term micro-backfill on front desk during launch week; offset by fewer repeat contacts by week 3–4.
- **System constraints**: if the vendor can’t expose booked phone slots, use a practice diary with SMS confirmations (patients care about the **promise**, not the plumbing). Your notes already show the “AI” system naming is vague — don’t let the tool dictate the service. fileciteturn1file0

---

## 8) The sales line to GTD’s leadership

- **Contract & CQC optics**: demonstrably “Responsive” and **equitable access** (analogue + digital), aligned with national expectations.
- **Cost**: tiny operational tweaks; savings from **failure-demand** collapse.
- **Differentiation**: “The first provider in GM to guarantee booked telephone times and a no-tech booking route.”
- **Proof**: 6-week pilot with a public, patient-friendly dashboard.

---

If you want, I can turn this into a one-pager slide/handout with the hook, the three equal doors diagram, the **no-deletion** policy box, and the 90-day targets — ready to drop in front of GTD and say: *“This is how you stand out without a single shiny new toy.”*


#### You:
okay good, but walk-ins don't jump the 'queue', they just get to make an appointment like anyone else, without ever having to get tech involved, or even without anyone even saying the words website or online to them, they don't even need to know it's in some bullshit PATCHS system if that wouldn't help them get treated.

#### ChatGPT:
\[Unsupported Content]


#### ChatGPT:
\[Unsupported Content]


#### ChatGPT:
100%—let’s bake that in. Here’s the tightened policy + plug-and-play wording so nobody pushes walk-ins toward tech or even mentions PATCHS unless the *patient* asks.

# Walk-In Parity (No-Tech) — Final Spec

## Service rule (what staff follow)

- **Three equal doors, one book:** Online (optional), Phone, **Walk-in**. All feed the same triage/diary. **No priority boost or penalty** by channel.
- **No forced digital, no tech talk:** For walk-ins, staff **must not** mention websites, apps, “online forms,” or PATCHS **unless the patient asks**.
- **Book real times:** Telephone = a **time** (e.g., 11:20), not a window. Face-to-face = a **time/date**.
- **Admin-on-behalf is silent:** If the system needs fields, reception enters the minimum **in the background**. The patient never has to see or touch a form.
- **No deletion for missed calls:** If a booked phone time is missed, keep the request open 48h and let the patient **rebook by phone or at reception** (still no tech).

## Front-desk script (use as-is)

> “Would you like a **booked** telephone slot or a **face-to-face**? I can **book that now**.”\
> *(If brief info needed)* “In a sentence or two, what’s the problem and how long has it been going on?”\
> *(Never say: ‘website’, ‘online form’, ‘PATCHS’, ‘you need the app’.)*

## What NOT to say (post this by the screens)

- “You need to fill the online form first.”
- “We only do bookings online.”
- “It’s on PATCHS.”
- “Can you go home and use the app?”

## What TO say instead

- “No app needed—I’ll **book it for you now**.”
- “Here’s your **appointment time** and a quick note with what to do if you need to change it.”
- “If you prefer, you can also **call us** to book next time.”

## Signage / website / IVR (keep it consistent)

- **Sign at reception:** “No app? No problem. **Book here or by phone.** We’ll give you a **time** you can plan around.”
- **IVR first line:** “To book without the app, press 1. We’ll give you a **booked** telephone or face-to-face appointment.”
- **Website banner (for optics, not pressure):** “Prefer not to go online? **Call or come in**—we’ll book you a time.”

## Diary & ops tweaks

- Reserve/release slots across all channels (e.g., 40% online, 40% phone, **20% walk-in**; adjust weekly).
- Short, fixed **phone slots** (5–7 min) in visible grids so reception can book confidently.
- Auto-SMS **only** as a courtesy (“Your phone appointment is **11:20** today.”). If the patient has no mobile, print a slip.

## Governance & guardrails

- **Mystery patient checks:** 5 walk-ins/week to ensure **no tech is mentioned** and a time is offered.
- **Missed-call audit:** target 0 silent closures; 100% get rebook options.
- **Accessibility flag:** “Analogue preference” on record so future contacts are booked directly, no prompts to “try online.”

## Executive pitch (how you’ll sell it)

> “Walk-ins don’t jump the queue—they **book into the same book** without a single digital hurdle or even hearing the word ‘online’. That removes failure-demand from re-submissions, stabilises throughput with **booked times**, and lifts reviews, fast—while keeping digital open for those who want it.”

Want me to turn this into a one-page SOP (staff script + signage + IVR copy) you can hand to the practice manager?


#### You:
we don't even need to book the patient a time in advance, either inside or outside the system, for many an advance text/sms message, like "A doctor will call you at 10:20 today, message back if this is a bad time", it won't catch all cases, but it should already catch enough. We also want to find out how much time the doctors are currently wasting waiting on calls to connect, it's probably almost as much (if not more) than they are saving by not just having appointments anyway. I can ask at the next PPG or during the training days for PATCHS onboarding.

#### ChatGPT:
Totally with you. Let’s treat this as a **micro-scheduling via SMS** pilot that (a) gives patients certainty *without* dragging them into apps/forms and (b) measures the real **wasted time on unanswered call-backs** so you can confront GTD with hard numbers.

# Micro-scheduling via SMS (no app, no forms)

## How it works (simple flow)

1. **T-30 to T-60 min pre-alert**\
   Send: *“A doctor will call you at **10:20** today. Reply **BAD** if this time won’t work.”*
   - Accepted replies: **OK** (or no reply), **BAD** (we’ll offer a new slot), **LATER** (patient proposes a time).
   - If BAD/LATER, reception offers the next available minute-specific time and confirms by SMS.
2. **T-5 min reminder** (optional): *“Reminder: we’ll call at **10:20**.”*
3. **Call at the exact time.** If no answer: leave one voicemail and **keep the request open** with an SMS rebook option (don’t delete).

Why this helps: it converts vague “sometime today” call-backs into **micro-appointments** patients can plan around — *without* exposing them to the system, websites, or PATCHS jargon.

## Guardrails (equity & safety)

- **No tech required**: If patient has no mobile/consent, reception still books a time (phone or face-to-face) and prints it.
- **Privacy by default**: SMS contains **no clinical details**. Offer STOP to opt-out.
- **No silent closures**: Missed call ≠ deleted request. Keep open 48h with easy rebook.

---

# Measure the waste (baseline → pilot)

## What to capture (takes \~15 seconds per call)

- Call attempt timestamps and **ring time seconds**.
- **Connected?** Y/N and **Outcome** (Completed / Rebooked / No answer / Voicemail / Busy).
- **Clinician wait minutes** (time lost ringing/queue/setup).
- **Admin minutes** (time spent rebooking/chasing).
- Whether **pre-alert sent** and patient **reply** (OK/BAD/LATER/No-reply).

I’ve made you a ready-to-use Excel tracker with the right columns + a guide sheet:

**[Download the tracker (Excel)](sandbox:/mnt/data/NBHC_Callback_MicroSchedule_Pilot.xlsx)**

Use it for:

- **2-week baseline** (current process).
- **2-week pilot** (SMS pre-alerts).\
  Compare: **no-answer rate, clinician wait minutes/call, admin minutes, % deletions (target 0).**

---

# What to ask at PPG / onboarding days

- **Clinician time lost:** “On average, how many minutes per call do you spend ringing/waiting before you connect or give up?”
- **No-answer frequency:** “Out of your call-backs yesterday, how many connected first try?”
- **Rework:** “How often do you have to try again / send a message / ask reception to chase?”
- **Policy on missed calls:** “When a patient misses the unscheduled call, what happens to their request?” (Surface any “we delete it” behaviour.)
- **SMS capability:** “Can we templatise a pre-alert + reminder with keywords (**BAD/LATER**) and pull a simple report?”

---

# Ready-to-send SMS templates

- **Pre-alert (T-30 to T-60):**\
  “New Bank: A doctor will call you at **{HH:MM} today**. Reply **BAD** if this time won’t work, or **LATER** with a better time. Do not reply with medical info.”
- **Reschedule offer (after BAD/LATER):**\
  “New Bank: We can call at **{HH:MM}**. Reply **OK** to confirm or **LATER** to suggest another time.”
- **Reminder (T-5):**\
  “New Bank: Reminder — your call is at **{HH:MM}**. If you need to change, reply **LATER**.”
- **Missed call follow-up:**\
  “New Bank: We tried to call at **{HH:MM}**. To rebook, reply **LATER** with a time or call reception. Your request stays open for 48 hours.”

(Keep them generic; no diagnoses, no results.)

---

# What GTD will like (the “sizzle”)

- **Fewer no-answers = fewer repeats** → lower clinician/admin waste (you’ll have minutes saved to show them).
- **Better reviews** fast: patients get certainty without being told to “use the app.”
- **Equity & compliance optics**: a clear analogue route and no deletion policy are easy wins to show CQC/ICB.

---

If you want, I can add a one-page “Pilot Plan” you can hand to the ops lead (timeline, roles, and the exact KPIs from the tracker).


#### You:
it's interesting how you always default to stupid shit that makes people act like computers. PATCHS has AI, they can facilitate free text, if implemented correctly, and the practice can co-ordinate with their provider for _some_ potential tweaks to the system if needed, especially if I can demonstrate improved patient throughput AND satisfaction, giving them higher reviews and more legitimacy to claim future additional practices under their control as franchises/licenses expire.

#### ChatGPT:
Totally. If PATCHS already has AI, then **use it to make the *computer act like a human*** — not to force humans to act like computers. Here’s a crisp plan you can drop in front of GTD + the PATCHS team that ties **throughput, satisfaction, and reviews** to a few concrete tweaks.

# “Free-Text First” Access (AI that listens, not interrogates)

## 1) Product principle (what you’re asking PATCHS to enable)

- **One big box, then stop.** Let patients **say/type it in their own words** (phone, walk-in, SMS, online). The AI structures it **behind the scenes** into: presenting problem, duration, red flags, impact, preferred mode/time. No more five near-duplicate textareas, no forced email+phone, no maze of fields. fileciteturn4file5turn4file19
- **Any door, same pipeline.** Free text can arrive via:
  - Online box (for those who like it)
  - **SMS reply** to the practice number (no app)
  - **IVR “say it in your own words”** → speech-to-text
  - **Reception** typing a one-liner on the patient’s behalf at the desk\
    All feed one queue; AI summarises for clinicians/admin. (Your pack already shows digital-only + duplicative forms are a core failure point.) fileciteturn4file12turn4file9
- **No silent deletions, ever.** Status must **notify the patient** and **offer rebook**, not close the ticket because two unscheduled rings were missed. (This is one of the loudest problems in your evidence.) fileciteturn4file8turn4file12

## 2) What the AI actually does (practical spec)

- **Summarise + code:** turn free text into a 5-line clinical summary + probable codes (SNOMED where possible) with **confidence flags**; highlight red-flag keywords; attach the raw text below for safety.
- **Auto-fill the admin:** contact preference (from message), best time hints, language/adjustment needs (“no smartphone”, “needs Urdu” → reception sees a banner).
- **One-click outcomes for staff:** “Book phone at 10:20 today”, “Book F2F tomorrow am”, “Pharmacy”, “Self-care + safety net”, “Home visit triage”.
- **Micro-schedule by text (no app):** outbound **pre-alert**: *“We’ll call at 10:20. Reply BAD/LATER if not.”* If BAD/LATER, the tool proposes the next times; reception confirms with one tap. (You’ve already framed this; it’s low lift and high impact.) fileciteturn4file5

## 3) Local changes GTD can do **now** (even before vendor changes)

- **Walk-in parity + no tech talk**: reception books or captures free text on the patient’s behalf; never mention PATCHS unless asked. (You’ve set this policy clearly.)
- **Pre-alert SMS at T-30–60** + optional T-5 reminder; keep the request open 48h with **self-rebook**. (You’ve got the pilot tracker ready to measure this.)
- **Either contact method, not both**: accept **phone OR email** so you don’t exclude people. Your notes show the *both required* rule blocks access. fileciteturn4file19
- **Publish the promise:** “Tell us in your own words. **Call, walk in, text, or use the box online.** We’ll give you a time you can plan around.” (Your reviews + notes show mixed messages and confusion; clarity alone wins points.) fileciteturn4file5turn4file15

## 4) Vendor tickets to raise with PATCHS (exact asks)

1. **Free-Text API endpoints** across channels (web, SMS, IVR, admin-on-behalf) → same triage queue.
2. **Relax mandatory fields** (allow phone-only or email-only). fileciteturn4file19
3. **Pre-alert + rebook workflows**: templates + keyword capture (OK/BAD/LATER) with audit trail; never auto-close on missed call. fileciteturn4file8
4. **Structured summary card** for clinicians with red-flag highlighting + raw text beneath.
5. **Audit/status notifications**: automatic SMS/email on any status change; explicit “request still open” after missed call. fileciteturn4file8turn4file12

## 5) KPIs that prove it worked (and sell the sizzle)

- **First-contact failure ↓** (target: cut from \~“4 in 10” toward ≤20%). fileciteturn4file12
- **No-answer rate ↓** after pre-alerts (baseline vs pilot).
- **Clinician wait minutes ↓** (ringing/queue) per successful contact — collect with your pilot sheet.
- **Repeat contacts ≤7 days ↓** (failure demand).
- **Review score +0.5★** in 90 days (New Bank and portfolio). Your GTD summary shows there’s headroom: most sites sit \~1.7–2.2★; **Smithy** is an outlier around 3.9★, proving better is possible under the same umbrella. fileciteturn4file6

## 6) Risk/controls (so leadership says “yes”)

- **Safety:** AI output **never** overwrites patient words; clinicians see raw text; red flags routed same-day.
- **Accessibility:** mark “analogue preference” so future contacts default to phone/walk-in; interpreter prompts.
- **Data:** generic SMS (no condition details), full audit on status changes; patients always notified. (Your pack documents current notification gaps.) fileciteturn4file8
- **Governance:** weekly 20-min huddle (ops lead, GP lead, reception, PPG rep) with a one-page metrics dashboard.

## 7) Why GTD should want this (their language)

- **Throughput up, rework down**: fewer duplicate forms, fewer no-answers, fewer angry chasers.
- **Better optics**: “First provider in GM where *anyone* can just say it in plain English (or any language) and get a time — **no app required**.”
- **Review lift** across a weak portfolio → stronger position when contracts re-procure/expire. (Your compiled evidence shows most GTD practices are rated poorly today; this is a differentiator.) fileciteturn4file0turn4file6

### Leave-behind for the onboarding/training day

- **5 patient scripts** to test end-to-end:
  1. “I’ve had a chesty cough for 4 days, worse at night, I drive a bus, can you call after 2pm?”
  2. “Diabetes meds running low; pharmacy says the app link isn’t working.” (no email, phone only) fileciteturn4file5
  3. “Dad needs a blood test; last 3 cancelled” (walk-in, no smartphone). fileciteturn4file17
  4. “Anxious + autistic; phone calls are hard; prefer face-to-face please.”
  5. “Urdu speaker; daughter texting on his behalf.”
- **Mystery shopper checks**: 5 walk-ins/week — ensure **no one** says “website/PATCHS/app”; ensure they get a **time** or a texted time without any digital hoops.
- **Metrics**: run your **Excel tracker** for 2 weeks baseline + 2 weeks with pre-alerts; present “minutes saved” and “no-answer drop” to leadership.

If you want, I can condense this into a one-page **Vendor Change Request** (with the 5 PATCHS tickets) and a **Pilot Charter** you can hand to New Bank + GTD HQ. It uses their own pain points (deletion, duplicative forms, confusion, bad reviews) as the business case and shows the “AI that listens” path is both **more humane** and **more efficient**. fileciteturn4file12turn4file19turn4file15
