# Access Issues: Worse Than Ever

## Why we’re here (human impact)

* **After-hours blackout:** the website shuts when the office shuts → shift workers/carers are locked out entirely *(PATCHS should already have an option to stay online)*.
* **Unscheduled calls:** patients wait all day; a missed call = start over.
* **Redundant/complex forms + multiple logins:** high friction and drop-offs; “NHS Login” complexity makes it worse.
* **No live portal/progress:** people can’t see status, can’t re-read a call, don’t know what happens next.
* **Corporate/generic wording:** unclear routes, multiple branches, no rationale; the path forward gets harder, not clearer.
* **Reality vs metrics:** appointment numbers look “fine” (slight improvement), but reviews and complaints say the opposite.

> **Example:** Works 7–7, form is always closed. Tries on a phone at work, misses a midday triage call, told to start again. By Friday they give up, get sicker. Most don’t bother to leave a review—because “nothing changes.”

## Scope of problem

* **Patient survey:** 39% said it’s hard to get an appointment.
	- Survey undercounts harm. Missing the people driven away at the front door. Real access failure is likely worse.
* **Public feedback:** Hundreds of 1–2★ Trustpilot complaints on PATCHS calling out downtime, confusion, restarts, bad process choices, repeating cycles of simple/avoidable errors. Google reviews on GTD practices already seeing bad reviews for new system.
* **Spot checks:** intake always **offline out of hours**; **error pages in hours** → the service feels unreliable.

## Bare minimum expectation

* **Always a way to start** (24/7 for non-urgent/admin).
* **Predictable next step** (clear acknowledgements and timeframes).
* **Fewer restarts** (don’t make people repeat themselves).

**Bottom line:** This isn’t just software—it’s process. Today’s defaults create avoidable harm. 

Switching to always-on intake, predictable/accessible comms, and fewer restarts is the minimum bar patients can feel.

## Notes

- The NHS 'goals' (only online during office hours, poor access minimums) are absolutely rock-bottom standards compared to the real world (Can you name one other industry whose website goes offline when their office is shut?). 
	- Healthcare/GP systems should be _better_ than other areas, more accessible, more human-friendly, not worse, systemic failure is a pattern everyone has to choose to break.
	- The NHS app as login would be fine, but it says it needs some other logins
		- Confusing, can't you just give me a link to the form? Several paths with long explanations.
		- Have been unable to test further, as it's always been down/offline or out of hours/offline.
	- Not a 'training' problem. The process is poor. 
		- I'm a programmer and system designer, confident and highly competent computer user, and just can't access it because it's offline, and still confusing. 
		- There are understandable/fair technical reasons... bad infrastructure, overly complex system controls, blind metrics, poor integration, lack of proper use case analytics during specification, and barely (if any) input from a professional designer (either at New Bank, GTD or PATCHS), competing priorities, legacy systems.
- Noticed New Bank recruiting for a receptionist on Indeed. Pretty low salary (~22k, barely living wage, with a lot of responsibilities). Any chance of paying more to get someone good at it, someone who cares about patients?
	- Are support systems in place to help reception help patients? Do they have enough autonomy to handle simple issues? Do they have enough power to respond to issues dynamically, or are they stuck filling in the same bad forms as patients?
