# Digital Access Failures – Raised December 2024, Escalated August 2025

## Patient Participation Group Talking Points - Appointment System Concerns

I’d like to discuss a problem with the appointment system at New Bank Health Centre that’s making it unnecessarily hard to get care. If a doctor can’t reach a patient by phone, the request is deleted outright, and they have to resubmit it the next day from scratch. This strips patients of control over their access to care for reasons like work, poor signal, or just missing a call. It’s frustrating, unfair, leads to patient-blaming instead of helpful outcomes, and I think it can be improved.

## Key Points to Raise

1. **Unpredictable Availability**

   - Patients can’t wait by the phone all day for an unscheduled call. Jobs, family, or technical issues (e.g., no signal) mean missing a call isn’t their fault.
   - **NHS Link**: NHS guidelines say appointments should be reasonable and consider patients’ circumstances.

2. **Deleted Requests Create Barriers**

   - Deleting requests after missed calls forces patients into a daily resubmission loop, delaying care with no guarantee of success.
   - **NHS Link**: The NHS Constitution calls for equitable access to care, but this system penalizes patients unfairly.

3. **Vulnerable Patients Suffer Most**

   - Elderly or disabled patients may struggle with the online form or being available for calls, risking exclusion from care.
   - **NHS Link**: NHS accessibility rules require alternative methods for those who can’t use digital systems.

4. **Misleading "Missed Appointment" Label**

   - Calling an unscheduled call a "missed appointment" isn’t accurate and might inflate statistics, affecting trust and policies like charging for no-shows.
   - **NHS Link**: Accurate appointment data is vital per NHS guidance—mislabeling distorts this.

5. **No Notification Worsens the Problem**

   - Patients aren’t always told when their request is deleted (I wasn't for 3 of the 4), leaving them confused and wasting time checking manually.
   - **NHS Link**: NHS England stresses clear communication from the first contact—patients deserve to know their request status.

## Solutions to Suggest

- **Don’t Delete Requests**: Keep appointment requests open for a set period (e.g., 48 hours) even if you rejected it, or ask the patient if they want to close it or reopen tomorrow automatically.
   - You don’t have to make multiple call attempts—we get time is tight—but 2 calls inside 20 seconds isn't giving patients time to spot a missed call to keep an eye out for another call, so it's no different from 1 call practically.
   - Patients should at least be able to reschedule (or even better escalate to non-phone path).
- **Schedule Call Windows**: Let patients pick a time range for callbacks to fit their lives.
- **Offer Alternatives**: Add phone or in-person booking for those who can’t use the online form. Your patient survey suggests 40% of people are not making it through your system for even a first appointment.
- **Notify Patients Reliably**: Send a text or email if a request is closed (which ideally it wouldn't be), with clear next steps. Likewise for support messages, which just black hole currently.
- **Have Some Empathy/Humanity**: People come to the doctor rarely, when they need help most... Most people are not as tech savvy as you, and certainly do not have comfortable devices for filling out long relatively complex forms multiple times or every day. When the receptionist treats people badly because it's technically the patient's own fault, it just drives them further away from your help.
- **Don't Make Doctors Call People**: A simple live-holding system where the Doctors review and queue requests, but a staff member makes the calls, and queues them into the Doctor as needed, would improve the process on both ends, with more flexibility and efficiency for everyone involved.s


## **CORE ISSUES**
- **Digital-only booking system** - no phone/in-person options
- **Unscheduled callbacks** - patients wait all day with no timeframe
- **Two-strikes deletion policy** - missed calls = deleted requests
- **No same-day resubmission** - must wait until next day
- **Misleading terminology** - "missed appointments" for unscheduled calls
- **Tiny text fields** insufficient space for entering detailed medical information
- **Poor notifications** - requests deleted without notification

## **IMPACT ON PATIENTS**
- **Vulnerable groups excluded** (elderly, disabled, digitally excluded)
- **Patient safety risks** - delays in care access
- **Mental health impact** - uncertainty and anxiety
- **Time wasted** - all-day waiting for uncertain outcomes
- **Statistical misrepresentation** - inflates "missed appointment" figures

## **EVIDENCE FROM REVIEWS**
- **40+ complaints** about appointment system since 2017
- **Average rating 1.5/5** for appointment-related complaints
- **Consistent themes**: long phone waits, confusing digital system, rude staff
- **Pattern**: Better Health MCR management (post-2017) shows significant decline

## **NHS POLICY VIOLATIONS**
- **Patient communication standards** - unclear notifications
- **Accessibility requirements** - no alternative booking methods
- **Data accuracy** - mischaracterizing missed calls as appointments
- **Patient rights** - equitable access not provided

## **ESCALATION PATH**
1. **Practice Manager** (direct complaint)
2. **Healthwatch Manchester** (0300 078 0669)
3. **NHS England** (0300 311 22 33)
4. **NHS Counter Fraud Authority** (if intentional misrepresentation suspected)

## **PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**
- **No Deletion** The patient didn’t magically recover. They reached out for help, and you deleted their request—sometimes with a dismissive, blame-shifting response.
- **Alternative booking methods** (phone/in-person)
- **Scheduled callback windows** instead of all-day waiting
- **Flexible missed call policy** - allow same-day resubmission
- **Clear notifications** when requests are closed
- **Accurate terminology** - don't call unscheduled calls "appointments"

## **BROADER IMPLICATIONS**
- **Systemic issue** - the doctors might be great, but some patients don't get the chance to find out
- **Potential fraud** - inflated missed appointment statistics
- **Public interest** - worth investigating across Manchester practices
- **Journalistic angle** - could escalate to Manchester Mill/Press
