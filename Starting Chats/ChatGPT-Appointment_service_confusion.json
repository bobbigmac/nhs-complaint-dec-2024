Problems with the appointment request form  \n- The appointment page still has the same tiny text fields as before, including multiple fields that are really asking the same thing:  \n\n  - **About the Patient’s Problem**  \n    *Please tell us about the problem. If the practice is already aware of this problem, please tell us what has changed. (Required)*  \n    [input textarea]  \n\n  - **How long has this been a problem?

It USED TO BE good, offering same day appointments as stated on their website as long as we fill in the form within the designated time. But now it’s going downhill and after reading other reviews and realising I’m not the only one it’s made me feel even more frustrated. I filled a form in a couple weeks ago and I called up to make sure they’re received my form and they’ll be offering me an appointment the same day. The receptionist told me the doctor has received my form and will definitely call me back that same day. I waited and waited, I was so ill I fell asleep and when I woke up I realised they’re closed, I double checked my call logs and I didn’t receive a single call. This has happened to me before where I’ve been ignored by them which is why I called up this time to make sure they’ll definitely call me back. The receptionist falsely reassured me that the doctor would “definitely” call me back that same day. I felt I had an infection and needed antibiotics but they didn’t even bother. I needed an emergency appointment. I waited another day thinking they might’ve been busy but still no call back, I ended up getting better on my own without any support from the gp. I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.\n\nI’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.\n🙏1\nRosemary Madakadze\na month ago\nJoyce Louis\nLocal Guide·16 reviews·15 photos\na month ago\nI'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery. I had a blood test scheduled but was given a date I couldn’t attend. When I managed to make time, the appointment was cancelled due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nThe new system for ordering medication is also a step backward. It was previously simple to order through the pharmacy app, but now it's linked to the NHS app, which requires identity verification. Despite submitting my details, I'm told it will take several days for confirmation—followed by additional delays for dispensing and delivery. This puts me at risk of running out of essential medication, which is unacceptable.\n\nThis level of service is deeply concerning. I will be looking to move to a more reliable GP surgery.\n❤️1\nJavad Moazami\n1 review\nEdited a month ago\nRating: 1/5 - Extremely DisappointingService\n\nUnfortunately, my experience at this clinic was very unpleasant. The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful. On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.\n\nWhen I encountered disrespectful and insulting behavior, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.\nAfter sharing this review, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) to find that several others had similar experiences at this clinic. Given how often such stories seem to come up, it might be worth taking a closer look—not just for me, but for others who may be facing similar situations.\n\nIn fact, what I’m about to describe is only one of several upsetting experiences I’ve had at this clinic—and sadly, not the last.\n\nI am not sure whether this was racially motivated, but the way I was treated was deeply inhumane. I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.\n\nAt that very moment, I briefly saw my doctor through a door behind one of the senior staff members—she appeared to say something to someone at a desk and then turned back and disappeared. Still, the staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress.\n\nAfter being kicked out of the clinic, I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless. I was in a mental health crisis, and the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day. The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.\n\nAnd this wasn’t the only time I was treated poorly. I had endured other incidents of disrespect and mistreatment before, but I didn’t know who to turn to or how to raise my concerns. So I kept silent. Eventually, I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.\n\nNo one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.\n\n❤️🙏8\nKlaudia Kania\n6 reviews\na month ago\nThe Worst GP in Manchester!\n\nI am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.\n\nTrying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.\n\nTerrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.\n\n❤️🙏🔥6\nMaha Elmi\n2 reviews\na month ago\nNo time for human been... very disappointed\n1\nchristian careddu\n1 review\n2 months ago\ni don’t know what to do no more.\nbeen waiting over a month for a referral letter to have access at my medications.\nthe staff at the counter says to wait another six weeks???\nwhile doesn’t let me speak with the practice manager, when she is basically there listening\n\n❤️🙏2\n","title":"reviews-between-aug-sept-meetings.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"97be9a1baec18880-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"32a58cfe-9ae1-4351-a7d2-d828ccdcb41c","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"32a58cfe-9ae1-4351-a7d2-d828ccdcb41c","children":["1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07"]},"1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07":{"id":"1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07","message":{"id":"1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757336150.4618514,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.  \n> I’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.*\n\n---\n\n### 4. Joyce Louis (a month ago) ⭐ 1/5  \n> *I'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery. I had a blood test scheduled but was given a date I couldn’t attend. When I managed to make time, the appointment was cancelled due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"  \n> The new system for ordering medication is also a step backward. It was previously simple to order through the pharmacy app, but now it's linked to the NHS app, which requires identity verification. Despite submitting my details, I'm told it will take several days for confirmation—followed by additional delays for dispensing and delivery. This puts me at risk of running out of essential medication, which is unacceptable.  \n> This level of service is deeply concerning. I will be looking to move to a more reliable GP surgery.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Javad Moazami (Edited a month ago) ⭐ 1/5  \n> *Unfortunately, my experience at this clinic was very unpleasant. The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful. On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.  \n> When I encountered disrespectful and insulting behavior, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.  \n> … I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.  \n> … the staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress.  \n> After being kicked out of the clinic, I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless. I was in a mental health crisis, and the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day. The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.  \n> … Eventually, I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.  \n> No one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.*\n\n---\n\n### 6. Klaudia Kania (a month ago) ⭐ 1/5  \n> *The Worst GP in Manchester!  \n> I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.  \n> Trying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.  \n> Terrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Maha Elmi (a month ago) ⭐ 1/5  \n> *No time for human been... very disappointed*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Christian Careddu (2 months ago) ⭐ 1/5  \n> *i don’t know what to do no more.  \n> been waiting over a month for a referral letter to have access at my medications.  \n> the staff at the counter says to wait another six weeks???  \n> while doesn’t let me speak with the practice manager, when she is basically there listening*\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to merge these into your **main points document** (so you can present your notes and the review evidence together in one pack), or keep them as a **separate appendix** you can refer to in the meeting?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acba6bea888191a332e9d3df6a3b4a","request_id":"97be9a1baec18880-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1684d38a-0813-4e68-9d91-091cf7789f07","children":["2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089"]},"2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089":{"id":"2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089","message":{"id":"2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757336244.403,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I've also requested information about the practices, as seen in attached file."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-EYc6ZSxiiXbu5CDJb4uNkM","size":2570,"name":"2025-08-26-email-for-takeover-dates-and-context.md","mime_type":"text/markdown","file_token_size":581,"source":"local"}],"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97be9c8a5be18880-MXP","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4a9b1118-bb19-4231-82a3-8d59b402ba31","children":["34239b27-01f1-4be9-9a12-84e8258f4c47"]},"34239b27-01f1-4be9-9a12-84e8258f4c47":{"id":"34239b27-01f1-4be9-9a12-84e8258f4c47","message":{"id":"34239b27-01f1-4be9-9a12-84e8258f4c47","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757336249.9676394,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"","summary":"","assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","request_id":"97be9c8a5be18880-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2f140048-54e2-4385-8478-8083d4480089","children":["35cfe60d-5997-4534-ac38-a895dbafefa0"]},"35cfe60d-5997-4534-ac38-a895dbafefa0":{"id":"35cfe60d-5997-4534-ac38-a895dbafefa0","message":{"id":"35cfe60d-5997-4534-ac38-a895dbafefa0","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757336250.1764128,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-EYc6ZSxiiXbu5CDJb4uNkM","domain":"2025-08-26-email-for-takeover-dates-and-context.md","text":"## Email Enquiry for Takeover Dates and Context\n\nSubject: *Request for information: GP Practice Management (PPG background research)*\n\nHello,\n\nAs a patient and member of the PPG at New Bank Health Centre, I’m preparing for our next meeting on September 10th and would like to clarify some background information about GTD Healthcare’s management of GP practices.

I’ve kept your wording intact and structured everything so you’ll have:  \n\n1. **Your drafted points on appointments, forms, reviews, and contact details**  \n2. **Recent Google reviews (6 Aug – 10 Sept)**  \n3. **Your email enquiry about GTD takeover dates and background info**  \n\nHere’s a clean outline you could take to the meeting:\n\n---\n\n# New Bank Health Centre – PPG Meeting Notes  \n*(Prepared for meeting on 10 September)*  \n\n---\n\n## A. Background Information Request (sent 26 August) 【14†2025-08-26-email-for-takeover-dates-and-context.md】  \n**Email to GTD Healthcare – awaiting reply**  \n- **Management Tenure**: Requested dates when GTD formally assumed responsibility for each practice.  \n- **Continuity of Staff**: Asked whether admin/reception staff were retained or replaced at handover.  \n- **Patient Feedback Handling**: Queried whether GTD reviews online patient feedback (Google, NHS website) and uses it for improvement.  \n- **Practice Performance Transparency**: Asked if GTD shares satisfaction data publicly. Noted that the only example found was “You said, we did (May 19)” (dated before 2022). Asked if updated versions exist.  \n- **Patient Access Standards**: Asked whether GTD has a standard access policy (e.g. wait time targets) applied across all practices.  \n\n---\n\n## B. Appointment System Issues  \n\n1. **Conflicting information on “same day” vs “within 1 working day”**  \n   - Front page says: *“We offer a same day appointment service …”*  \n   - Next page says: *“We will respond within 1 working day during opening times.”*  \n   - Next page also says: *“Complete this form before 4pm … It’s ok to complete this form the night before.”*  \n   - **Unclear**: Is it same day or next day? Do you fill in the form the day before, by 4pm, or before 8am (as some older reviews suggest)?  \n\n2. **Appointment request form design**  \n   - Fields are repetitive and poorly designed, leading to duplication or lost info:  \n     - “About the problem” (textarea)  \n     - “How long has this been a problem?” (textbox)  \n     - “Ideas about the cause” (textarea)  \n     - “What are the concerns?” (textarea)  \n     - “How would you like the doctor/nurse to help?” (textarea)  \n   - Recently added: *“When would you be available today for a phone call or video appointment (if needed)?”* — a **marginal improvement** but still not an actual scheduled appointment.  \n\n3. **Contact details requirement**  \n   - Both phone number **and** email address are required.  \n   - Issue: excludes patients who only have one. *“Good luck if you don’t have one or the other. You’re fucked I suppose.”*  \n\n---\n\n## C. Review Evidence (6 Aug – 10 Sept) 【8†reviews-between-aug-sept-meetings.txt】  \n\n- **Blood test cancellations** (Z, 3 weeks ago) – appointment cancelled *four times*, told to go to MRI, receptionist hung up.  \n- **Patient struck off** (Kenny J, edited a month ago) – removed from practice after moving 400m, unable to get scan results.  \n- **Broken promises & no call back** (Shadow S, a month ago) – form submitted, told doctor would call same day, no call received, left unwell without antibiotics, had to take sick leave.  \n- **Medication ordering problems** (Joyce Louis, a month ago) – new NHS app process caused dangerous delays; blood test also cancelled.  \n- **Severe reception staff mistreatment** (Javad Moazami, a month ago) – ignored, mocked, shouted at, kicked out while in mental health crisis, left in tears, later struck off.  \n- **General dysfunction** (Klaudia Kania, a month ago) – called “The Worst GP in Manchester”; rude staff, broken systems, impossible appointment booking, calls for overhaul.  \n- **Lack of compassion** (Maha Elmi, a month ago) – “No time for human been… very disappointed.”  \n- **Referral delay** (Christian Careddu, 2 months ago) – waiting over a month for a referral letter, told to wait another six weeks, denied access to practice manager.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **combine all of this into a polished briefing pack** (like a single printable document), or would you prefer to keep your own notes separate and just have me tidy the reviews and email sections into an appendix?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":604,"end_ix":659,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"2025-08-26-email-for-takeover-dates-and-context.md","id":"file-EYc6ZSxiiXbu5CDJb4uNkM","source":"my_files","text":"## Email Enquiry for Takeover Dates and Context\n\nSubject: *Request for information: GP Practice Management (PPG background research)*\n\nHello,\n\nAs a patient and member of the PPG at New Bank Health Centre, I’m preparing for our next meeting on September 10th and would like to clarify some background information about GTD Healthcare’s management of GP practices.

It USED TO BE good, offering same day appointments as stated on their website as long as we fill in the form within the designated time. But now it’s going downhill and after reading other reviews and realising I’m not the only one it’s made me feel even more frustrated. I filled a form in a couple weeks ago and I called up to make sure they’re received my form and they’ll be offering me an appointment the same day. The receptionist told me the doctor has received my form and will definitely call me back that same day. I waited and waited, I was so ill I fell asleep and when I woke up I realised they’re closed, I double checked my call logs and I didn’t receive a single call. This has happened to me before where I’ve been ignored by them which is why I called up this time to make sure they’ll definitely call me back. The receptionist falsely reassured me that the doctor would “definitely” call me back that same day. I felt I had an infection and needed antibiotics but they didn’t even bother. I needed an emergency appointment. I waited another day thinking they might’ve been busy but still no call back, I ended up getting better on my own without any support from the gp. I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.\n\nI’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.\n🙏1\nRosemary Madakadze\na month ago\nJoyce Louis\nLocal Guide·16 reviews·15 photos\na month ago\nI'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery.

The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful. On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.\n\nWhen I encountered disrespectful and insulting behavior, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.\nAfter sharing this review, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) to find that several others had similar experiences at this clinic. Given how often such stories seem to come up, it might be worth taking a closer look—not just for me, but for others who may be facing similar situations.\n\nIn fact, what I’m about to describe is only one of several upsetting experiences I’ve had at this clinic—and sadly, not the last.\n\nI am not sure whether this was racially motivated, but the way I was treated was deeply inhumane. I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.\n\nAt that very moment, I briefly saw my doctor through a door behind one of the senior staff members—she appeared to say something to someone at a desk and then turned back and disappeared. Still, the staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress.\n\nAfter being kicked out of the clinic, I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless. I was in a mental health crisis, and the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day. The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.\n\nAnd this wasn’t the only time I was treated poorly. I had endured other incidents of disrespect and mistreatment before, but I didn’t know who to turn to or how to raise my concerns. So I kept silent. Eventually, I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.\n\nNo one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.\n\n❤️🙏8\nKlaudia Kania\n6 reviews\na month ago\nThe Worst GP in Manchester!\n\nI am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.\n\nTrying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration.

Could you please confirm the following:\n\n1. Management Tenure\n   – The dates (year and month, if available) when GTD Healthcare formally assumed responsibility for each of your GP practices (e.g. New Bank Health Centre transferred April 2025).\n\n2. Continuity of Staff\n   – At each practice handover, whether core administrative/reception staff remained in post, or if significant staffing changes were made at the time.\n\n3. Patient Feedback Handling\n   – Whether GTD has an internal process for collecting and reviewing online patient feedback (e.g. Google reviews, NHS website feedback), and if/how this is used in practice improvement.\n\n4. Practice Performance Transparency\n   – Whether GTD routinely shares patient satisfaction data (beyond CQC reports) with patients or the public, and if so where this can be accessed. \n   – I found your one-page flyer titled “You said, we did (May 19)” (link in footnotes). It appears to date from before 2022 at least (according to the PDF metadata), but it wasn’t explicitly dated, and I haven’t been able to find any more recent reports in this style. Could you confirm whether updated versions exist, and the timescale that content related to?\n\n5. Patient Access Standards\n   – Does GTD have a standard policy or minimum expectation for patient access (e.g. typical wait time targets for routine or urgent appointments), and is this applied across all your GP practices?\n\nA short reply covering the above points would be very helpful. It doesn’t need to be exhaustive if some information is sensitive or hard to collate; I’m simply hoping to fill in some background gaps ahead of the PPG meeting.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nKind regards,\nRobert Davies\nPatient and member of PPG at New Bank Health Centre\n\nFootnotes\nFlyer link for reference: https://www.gtdhealthcare.co.uk/application/files/5517/4107/9706/You_said_we_did_poster_-_May_19.pdf\n\n* GTD Healthcare main contact:\n  to: [gtd.feedback@nhs.net](mailto:gtd.feedback@nhs.net) (listed as general enquiries)\n  cc: [communications.gtd@nhs.net](mailto:communications.gtd@nhs.net) (fallback)\n  cc: [gtd.corporateaffairs@nhs.net](mailto:gtd.corporateaffairs@nhs.net) (corporate comms)\n","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":14,"message_id":"35cfe60d-5997-4534-ac38-a895dbafefa0","file_index":null,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"【8†reviews-between-aug-sept-meetings.txt】","start_idx":2765,"end_idx":2806,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"reviews-between-aug-sept-meetings.txt","id":"file-HXF8G3R9Tns5bjJxE8pdCf","source":"my_files","snippet":"\nZ\n1 review\n3 weeks ago\nNew\nThey cancelled a blood test appointment for my dad 4 times and then on the 4th cancellation were told to go to MRI for a routine blood test!

It USED TO BE good, offering same day appointments as stated on their website as long as we fill in the form within the designated time. But now it’s going downhill and after reading other reviews and realising I’m not the only one it’s made me feel even more frustrated. I filled a form in a couple weeks ago and I called up to make sure they’re received my form and they’ll be offering me an appointment the same day. The receptionist told me the doctor has received my form and will definitely call me back that same day. I waited and waited, I was so ill I fell asleep and when I woke up I realised they’re closed, I double checked my call logs and I didn’t receive a single call. This has happened to me before where I’ve been ignored by them which is why I called up this time to make sure they’ll definitely call me back. The receptionist falsely reassured me that the doctor would “definitely” call me back that same day. I felt I had an infection and needed antibiotics but they didn’t even bother. I needed an emergency appointment. I waited another day thinking they might’ve been busy but still no call back, I ended up getting better on my own without any support from the gp. I had to call in sick to work as I didn’t have any medication to make me better any sooner.\n\nI’ve been feeling ill again for the past week and I’ve not even bothered filling a form in or calling up to book an appointment because of how bad the service is and as I know I’ll just be neglected yet again. This isn’t how one should feel when in need of support. This practice really needs to fix up and get rid of all the slackers.\n🙏1\nRosemary Madakadze\na month ago\nJoyce Louis\nLocal Guide·16 reviews·15 photos\na month ago\nI'm extremely disappointed with the recent changes at this GP surgery. I had a blood test scheduled but was given a date I couldn’t attend. When I managed to make time, the appointment was cancelled due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nThe new system for ordering medication is also a step backward. It was previously simple to order through the pharmacy app, but now it's linked to the NHS app, which requires identity verification. Despite submitting my details, I'm told it will take several days for confirmation—followed by additional delays for dispensing and delivery. This puts me at risk of running out of essential medication, which is unacceptable.\n\nThis level of service is deeply concerning. I will be looking to move to a more reliable GP surgery.\n❤️1\nJavad Moazami\n1 review\nEdited a month ago\nRating: 1/5 - Extremely DisappointingService\n\nUnfortunately, my experience at this clinic was very unpleasant. The behavior of the reception team was seriously unprofessional and disrespectful. On several occasions, they were either absent or busy with other tasks, leaving me waiting for long periods without any guidance. I was never informed that I needed to use the automated check-in system, and even if I had been informed, I would have required assistance.\n\nWhen I encountered disrespectful and insulting behavior, none of the reception staff paid attention to the issue, which caused significant distress and psychological pressure. It seems that the clinic manager is not paying attention to these problems and is not hearing the voices of patients.\nAfter sharing this review, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) to find that several others had similar experiences at this clinic. Given how often such stories seem to come up, it might be worth taking a closer look—not just for me, but for others who may be facing similar situations.\n\nIn fact, what I’m about to describe is only one of several upsetting experiences I’ve had at this clinic—and sadly, not the last.\n\nI am not sure whether this was racially motivated, but the way I was treated was deeply inhumane. I begged them to inform my doctor—who had been regularly renewing my weekly prescription for over a year—that I had run out of critical medication. They completely ignored me and, instead of offering help, shouted at me to leave the clinic.\n\nAt that very moment, I briefly saw my doctor through a door behind one of the senior staff members—she appeared to say something to someone at a desk and then turned back and disappeared. Still, the staff insisted she wasn’t there. When I told one of the senior team members—who seemed to be in charge or at least more experienced than the others—what I had seen, she and her colleagues pointed at me, laughed at my desperation, and mocked me while I stood there in distress.\n\nAfter being kicked out of the clinic, I walked away with tears in my eyes, feeling utterly humiliated, unwanted, and hopeless. I was in a mental health crisis, and the lack of compassion pushed me to a point where I genuinely started thinking about ending my life. The pain of that moment hasn’t left me—it replays in my mind every single day. The medication that helped me cope was gone, and so was my sense of dignity.\n\nAnd this wasn’t the only time I was treated poorly. I had endured other incidents of disrespect and mistreatment before, but I didn’t know who to turn to or how to raise my concerns. So I kept silent. Eventually, I found the courage to tell my doctor honestly and emotionally what had been happening—only to be removed from the GP a few days later.\n\nNo one should ever be made to feel that way in a place that is supposed to provide care.\n\n❤️🙏8\nKlaudia Kania\n6 reviews\na month ago\nThe Worst GP in Manchester!\n\nI am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by this practice. The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one.\n\nTrying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care.\n\nTerrible experience, awful management.
