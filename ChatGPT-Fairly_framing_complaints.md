# Fairly framing complaints

#### You:
Okay, I think a way of understanding/presenting/framing this issue is starting to develop in my mind, that helps me keep the complaint in context. I'm frustrated that very simple things like a website that doesn't shut down when the office does, and needless unscheduled phone calls, and starting over workflows that discourage or even harm the patient, and bad/complex forms that make access harder, and these are entirely justified complaints that ARE driven by systemic causes... but... it's also the case that the staff _are_ trying to do what is mandated of them (say min in-office web-online times as a bare minimum), whilst being stuck within a system that thinks (because of being conditioned to do so) that the bare minimum is acceptable, and failing to even reach that because it seems like a difficult goal. They don't have the resources of a tech company or even an agency, so can't just 'make their own' solution (say for a patient self-management dashboard with modern features you would expect (AND nhs app integration, even though that backbone is also crap)), so are limited to crappy tools like PATCHS where some researcher thought he'd take a crack at it, without once considering the effects on end-users/patients, because he was more interested in if he could, not if he should do better. I don't know what to do with this yet, I'm just trying to understand the nuance of how to fairly make reasonable demands of a corporate team that doesn't even know they're 20 years behind everyone else, and even if they did, they'd have their own perspective on causes that muddy the waters on introducing any real solutions anyway. 

I'm not looking for an action plan, but I need considerations I should mull over while deciding how to address these issues respectfully, and without jargon. This team seem especially susceptible to turning a mountain into a molehill, and getting distracted by details, so I want to try and humanise the issue, to encourage solving it by 'feel' rather than by mechanics (which are geared to metrics that just make it look like problems have been mitigated). What do I need to think about for this?

Love this framing. Here are practical, non-jargony things to keep in your head (and on the table) when you talk about it—aimed at keeping people human-first and out of the weeds.

# Mindset that keeps it fair

- **Separate people from the process.** “I know you’re doing what’s required; I’m questioning the setup, not you.”
- **Assume good intent, name bad outcomes.** “No one designed this to be hard—but it is.”
- **Start from shared values.** Safety, access, dignity, continuity—nobody in the room is against these.
- **Describe constraints without treating them as destiny.** “We’re resource-limited, so let’s choose the *least* harmful defaults.”

# What to foreground (so they don’t shrink the problem)

- **The human cost of small frictions.** Missed wages, childcare, anxiety, conditions worsening.
- **Dead ends vs delays.** Delays are painful; dead ends are harmful. Aim for “no dead ends.”
- **Continuity loss.** Every restart wastes patient story + clinical context.
- **Predictability.** Patients can tolerate waiting; they struggle with uncertainty and surprise phone calls.

# Frames that land with clinicians (not metrics)

- **Safety = timely contact + clear fallback.** Safe care includes safe access.
- **Equity lens.** Systems that require 9–5 availability exclude shift workers and carers.
- **Harm by design.** If the default blocks after 5pm, we’re baking in avoidable harm.
- **Cognitive load.** Bad forms shift work to patients and reception; good ones reduce rework.
- **Continuity beats capacity tricks.** “More handoffs” ≠ “more access.”

# Use tiny stories, not dashboards

- **Three 30-second vignettes** you can read aloud: a shift worker, a carer with two kids, an anxious patient who avoids phones. Keep each to 3 lines: context → barrier → consequence. (Stories stick; charts bounce.)

# Simple litmus tests (help them “feel” good vs bad)

- **“Would this be okay for my mum on a bad day?”**
- **“Can a patient complete this at 10pm without starting over tomorrow?”**
- **“Is there *always* a path forward?”** (No hard stops; always a fallback.)
- **“Can we explain this change in one sentence on the website?”** If not, too fiddly.
- **“Does this reduce or increase restarts for staff?”** Fewer restarts = everyone wins.

# Language that de-escalates

- Swap **“non-compliant patients”** → **“system didn’t fit their day.”**
- Swap **“demand management”** → **“making access predictable and safe.”**
- Swap **“we don’t have capacity”** → **“let’s choose safer defaults within capacity.”**
- Swap **“policy says”** → **“our responsibility is…”** (keeps ownership in the room).

# Boundaries & minimums (floor vs ceiling)

- **Floor:** “Open, reliable intake in core hours, and *never* a dead end when tools fail.”
- **Ceiling:** “24/7 submission for non-urgent/admin with next-working-day triage.”
- **Non-negotiables:** Clear response times, clear fallback (111/999 + how to reach the PCN hub), no unscheduled call-backs without offering text/portal first.

# How to avoid getting dragged into detail

- **Ban the rabbit holes.** If someone dives into edge-case forms logic, pull back: “Let’s first agree the principle: no dead ends and predictable responses. We can fit the form to that.”
- **Use “north-star” statements.** One sentence you repeat: “Patients must be able to *start* anytime and *know what happens next*.”
- **Chunk asks.** Principle → policy → configuration. Don’t start at configuration.

# What to *measure without gaming*

- **Time to first acknowledgement** (not “tickets closed”).
- **% submissions that needed a restart** (patient-reported).
- **% contacts resolved without a phone call** (choice, not avoidance).
- **Patient understanding of “what happens next”** (one-question pulse).

# Respectful prompts that keep hearts open

- “What part of this *feels* wrong to you as a clinician?”
- “If a family member worked shifts, what would you expect from us?”
- “Where are *we* adding admin pain to patients or reception without meaning to?”

# Red flags to notice in the room

- **Policy as shield.** (“We can’t because policy.”) → Ask: “What’s the safest default *within* policy?”
- **Capacity fatalism.** (“We’re full; end of.”) → Ask: “What’s the least harmful overflow?”
- **Tool worship.** (“PATCHS can’t.”) → Reframe: “Tools serve the principle; otherwise we change the setup.”

# A tiny, human closing you can use

- “I’m not asking for heroics—just default settings that don’t punish people for working hours or bad days. Can we agree on *no dead ends*, *predictable replies*, and *fewer restarts* as the bar we hold ourselves to?”

If you want, I can turn this into a one-pager you can read out at the PPG or a slide with the litmus tests and story snippets—plain English, no metrics.
