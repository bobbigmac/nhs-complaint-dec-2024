# GP practice benchmarks UK

#### You:
I'm preparing for the meeting on Sept 10th, and want to put together a big-picture and metrics style report on expectations around the issues discussed in this project among comparable GP practices, especially those in Manchester, but anywhere in the UK is relevant.

We need a good idea of how many patients are expected to be registered at a typical GP surgery, how many will attend an appointment in a given month or year, how many typically encounter access problems, and what type of feedback is usually provided, both to the practice management, through the NHS patient survey systems, and even through google reviews.
We also need to know how many patients are typically seen by a doctor in a day and/or week, what days of the week are usually like, how much additional paperwork or process load they're usually carrying, and a brief understanding of other pressures that might affect how much 'work' a doctor can do (i.e. what's stopping them just seeing patient after patient all day?)

We also want to get an idea of adminstration and management staff duties, typical feedback about receptionists and admin staff, process blockers and how things like training and incompetence issues are handled more broadly. Standards around patient support and 'customer service' might also be useful to put into context.

We're looking to paint a numbers-based picture of exactly what an operational GP practice in the UK looks like today, and to identify the scale from poorly operating ones to excellent ones, with the intention of identifying properties we should be looking for to improve our own practice, its access and treatment practices, especially when 3 of the 5 doctors just quit, so we're very under-resourced, and our admin-staff are rude and unhelpful, but we can't just fire them because we don't have replacements. We need to understand the practical reality of GP practices around the country so we can start setting some performance benchmarks moving forward, and through trialling alternative approaches, how we might treat our patients better, efficiently, and more favourably compare to other practices.

#### ChatGPT:
To build an accurate and metrics-based picture of comparable GP practices in the UK, especially in Manchester, could you confirm a few things to help narrow the scope:

1. Are you primarily interested in NHS-funded GP practices only, or should we include private clinics too?
2. Is there a particular patient population size range you’d like to focus on (e.g., small practices <5,000 patients, average \~10,000, large >15,000)?
3. Do you want metrics broken down regionally (e.g., Manchester ICS vs national), or is national average sufficient for most?
4. Are you seeking current data only (last 1–2 years), or is trend data over time (e.g., since 2018 or pre/post-COVID) useful too?

Once confirmed, I’ll begin assembling a national overview with appointment volumes, access challenges, staff workloads, admin and customer service feedback, and benchmarks from well-performing vs under-performing practices.


#### You:
NHS is the primary interest. There's not much point comparing to private surgeries, but some statements for context (that briefly put our failures in context of 'a perfect world') might help, but shouldn't be the main focus.
Our practice is in Longsight, Manchester. A solid estimate of catchment/patient-counts and issues, might be useful if comparable practices with similar issues are considered.
Whatever breakdown you have, I'll take it.
The last few years is crucial, as a lot of places seem to be facing similar issues, especially since moving to digital-only systems (or digital-first, where the non-digital component is HARD to access because of processes established during the pandemic when they were a solution to a different problem, so the priorities about access were different than they are today). The pandemic is relevant in its effects, but primarily we want to compare to other practices, regions and management companies of various types. Temporaility is less important.

#### ChatGPT:
Great, I’ll compile a metrics-based overview of what typical NHS GP practices look like today across the UK, with a focus on Manchester and comparable urban practices. This will include patient registration volumes, appointment volumes, access issues, staffing workloads, admin responsibilities, patient satisfaction data (NHS surveys and public reviews), and standards for support and service.

I'll also identify what distinguishes poor vs excellent practices in measurable terms, to help guide realistic improvement goals for your own surgery, especially given your current resourcing and operational challenges.

I’ll let you know as soon as the report is ready.

# Practice and Patient Registrations

- **England (mid-2025):** \~63.82 million registered patients in \~6,229 practices【23†L184-L189】【7†L531-L536】.  Average list size ≈10,250 patients (63.8M/6229). Patients per FTE GP ≈2,257 (2257)【23†L184-L189】.  BMA reports an all-time high of 63.8M patients (July 2025)【7†L531-L536】 with 28,278 full-time equivalent (FTE) GPs, yielding \~2,257 patients per FTE GP【23†L184-L189】.
- **Greater Manchester:** Registered population \~3.249 million (Dec 2022)【24†L126-L134】.  FTE GPs ≈1,418 (Dec 2022)【24†L126-L134】, giving ≈2,291 patients per GP【24†L131-L134】.  (This is slightly higher than the England average).  In Manchester City, \~709,000 patients were registered (Nov 2022) across 14 PCNs【29†L369-L374】; list sizes range from \~1,900 to 28,130【29†L369-L374】, implying an average practice list on the order of 10–12,000.

**Table 1.** *GP Practice/Patient Metrics – England vs Greater Manchester*

| Metric              | England (2025)             | Greater Manchester (2022)   | Source                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Registered patients | 63.82 million【7†L531-L536】 | 3.249 million【24†L126-L134】 | NHS England/BMA; \[24] |
| GP practices        | 6,229【23†L184-L189】        | – (PCNs: 14)                | \[23]                  |
| FTE GPs             | 28,278【7†L531-L536】        | 1,418【24†L126-L134】         | \[7]; \[24]            |

# Appointment Volumes

- **Annual totals (England):** General practice delivered \~367.4 million appointments in 2023/24【4†L281-L284】 (22.5% higher than 2019).  By July 2025, \~370 million standard appointments were booked (≈1.42 million per working day)【7†L540-L548】.  GPs themselves delivered \~176.4 million of those (≈44% of total)【7†L558-L561】.
- **Per-practice (England):** Average GP appointments per practice \~25,439/year in 2023/24【4†L281-L284】 (i.e. \~2,120/month).  Including all staff (nurses etc.), a rough back-of-envelope is \~370m/6229 ≈59,500 appointments per practice-year (≈4,950/month).
- **Per-GP:** NHS data indicate each GP conducts on the order of 4,500–4,600 appointments per year【4†L215-L218】.  (For example, *“GP appointments per GP… 4,529 in 2019 and 4,499 in 2024”*【4†L215-L218】.)  This corresponds to roughly 85–90 appointments per week (assuming 48 working weeks), i.e. around 15–20 patient contacts per clinical day.  (BMA data imply \~28,000 GPs providing \~176.4m appointments → \~6,240 appts/year per FTE GP, but that count may include lower-duration contacts.)  In summer 2025 about 13.2 million GP appointments occurred in a month【22†L238-L243】, implying on the order of 600–700 GP-led consultations per working day nationally.

# GP Clinical Load (per GP)

- **Daily/Weekly Patients:**  Contractually, practices must offer **75 appointments per 1,000 registered patients per week**【40†L142-L150】.  For an average GP list (\~2,250 patients), that is \~170 appts/week.  In practice, GPs report higher demand: many surveys find GPs seeing \~35–40 patients per day.  For instance, a 2021 GP survey (Pulse) found GPs working \~11-hour days seeing \~37 patients【54†L104-L113】 (well above the traditional “safe” target of \~28/day).  Using the NHS figure \~4,500 appts/year per GP【4†L215-L218】, that is about 18–19 patient contacts per day (5-day week, 48 weeks/year), though in busy practices numbers can reach 25–30 per day.
- **Workload Trends:** Demand for appointments has sharply risen since the pandemic: monthly GP contacts remain well above pre-2020 levels【4†L281-L284】.  In Jan 2023 NHS data showed \~9m 10-minute appts and \~11m longer appts in a month【40†L153-L160】, indicating that more complex cases require extended time.

# Workload and Administrative Burden

- **Clinical vs Admin Time:** GPs spend a substantial fraction of their time on non-patient-facing tasks.  BMA guidance notes a typical *salaried* GP has a clinical:administrative time ratio of about 3:1【46†L506-L509】 (i.e. \~75% clinical, 25% admin, excluding meetings).  Partners often carry even more administrative responsibility.  Many GPs report working extra unpaid hours to handle paperwork and follow-ups.  One analysis noted **“more than 75% of GPs undertake additional work each week equivalent to an additional unpaid session”**【40†L189-L194】.  This unpaid extra work (sorting letters, repeat prescriptions, results, referral paperwork, etc.) often spills outside core hours.
- **Hours Worked:**  Research shows average GP contracted hours have fallen (median FTE \~0.69 by 2022, about 26 hours/week)【51†L352-L360】; however those hours are heavily loaded.  In reality, many GPs work beyond contracted hours.  For example, a national survey found a large majority of GPs worked \~11-hour days on average, often feeling that workload was unsafe【54†L104-L113】.  Extended working is driven by admin backlog, complex patients, and additional roles (CCGs, PCNs, teaching).

# Patient Access and Booking Issues

- **Contact Methods:** Practices now use a mix of phone, online and in-person access.  As of 2022, \~37.7% of GP consultations were by telephone (up from \~10% pre-pandemic)【63†L200-L205】, with the remainder mostly face-to-face【22†L238-L243】 (by June 2025 \~63% F2F【22†L238-L243】, \~37% remote).  Many practices use “total triage” (online form or call-back triage) systems.  The NHS App and online booking are growing (33.6M app users by Dec 2023【66†L28-L33】), but patients without internet or digital skills can face a barrier if practices adopt “digital-first” policies (requesting forms via e-consult instead of a receptionist).
- **Phone Access:** GPPS data show **only \~50%** of patients find it easy to get through to the practice by phone【68†L198-L201】 (the lowest in over a decade).  Long call queues and “phone line open” windows remain a common complaint.  By contrast, some reports indicate higher satisfaction with online booking/apps, but these can exclude older or vulnerable patients.
- **Missed Appointments (“DNAs”):**  Roughly 6–10% of booked GP appointments are missed (pre-pandemic).  NHS figures estimated \~7.2 million GP appts missed in 2019【63†L174-L182】 (about 10% of \~72m yearly appointments then).  The proportion has fallen somewhat with triage systems, since many contacts are same-day calls【63†L214-L223】.  Missed appointments waste GP time and delay care; reasons include forgetfulness, work commitments, transport, and dissatisfaction with system.  Practices usually have policies (often allowing a second booking if a patient misses one), but patients report **“resubmission friction”** when forced to repeat their request if a digital form is rejected or an appointment is missed without timely follow-up.  Clearer reminder systems (texts/email) and more flexible rebooking are considered best practice.

# Patient Satisfaction and Feedback

- **GP Patient Survey (GPPS) Results:**  Nationally, patient satisfaction has dipped in recent years.  In the 2023 GPPS, only **71.3%** rated their overall experience as “good”【68†L193-L201】 (down from 72.4% in 2022).  Key findings include:  only **49.8%** found it easy to get through by phone【68†L198-L201】, and just **54.4%** said their experience making an appointment was good【68†L201-L204】.  Notably, **27.9%** of patients avoided booking at all because it felt “too difficult”【68†L204-L207】 (up from 11.1% in 2021).  Once seen, patients report high confidence in their GP (93.0%) and that their needs were met (91.0%)【68†L218-L222】.

  | **Experience Measure (GPPS 2023)**       | **England %**       | **Source**        |
  | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
  | Good overall experience of GP practice   | 71.3%【68†L193-L201】 | GP Patient Survey |
  | Easy to get through by phone             | 49.8%【68†L198-L201】 | GP Patient Survey |
  | Good experience of making an appointment | 54.4%【68†L201-L204】 | GP Patient Survey |
  | Avoided booking (too difficult)          | 27.9%【68†L204-L207】 | GP Patient Survey |
  | Confidence/trust in last GP seen         | 93.0%【68†L218-L222】 | GP Patient Survey |
  | Felt needs met at last appointment       | 91.0%【68†L218-L222】 | GP Patient Survey |

- **Local (Manchester) Context:**  Manchester patients generally reflect these national trends, with many practices noting long waits and frustrated patients in local forums.  (For example, the Longsight New Bank Health Centre was CQC-rated *Good* in 2018【92†L95-L103】 despite recent management changes.)  Analysis of practice-level GPPS data (available via NHS England) shows inner-city practices often score lower on access. Google and NHS.UK reviews often echo GPPS complaints: praise for individual GPs/co-ordinators but common criticism of appointment booking and reception.

# Reception and Admin Staff Roles

Receptionists and administrative teams are the *front line* of patient access.  Their duties include answering calls, handling walk-in patients, managing appointment schedules, triaging urgent cases, processing e-consultation forms, and dealing with prescriptions/referrals.  In many practices they also collect waiting-room vitals or help with long-term care reviews.

**Sources of Negative Feedback:**  Patients frequently complain of:

- **Long waits/inflexibility:**  “Rang for 30 minutes” or “only online booking” frustrations.
- **Perceived rudeness or dismissal:** Under stress, some staff come across as curt (studies note receptionists bear much patient frustration).
- **Poor communication:** e.g. “told wrong day/time” or “asked inappropriate health questions at front desk”.
- **Lack of transparency:** patients often do not understand triage protocols and blame receptionists when unable to see a GP quickly.

Conversely, **helpfulness** is rated highly in surveys (GPPS routinely finds \~80–90% say receptionists are helpful).  Best-practice reception teams balance efficiency with empathy, and some practices use scripts or special training in communication to manage difficult calls.  Creating a “sit-and-wait” same-day triage clinic or offering web chat can also reduce reception pressure.

# Training and Standards for Admin Staff

GP practice staff must meet general NHS statutory training requirements, though there is no separate national qualification for receptionists.  Mandatory training typically covers **safeguarding (children and adults), health & safety, infection control, fire safety, equality & diversity, and data protection/confidentiality**.  The BMA provides a training checklist for practice teams【75†L439-L447】.  CQC inspections expect evidence that *all* staff have up-to-date training in these areas.  Some practices supplement this with “customer service” or conflict management training for front-desk staff.  Performance standards are enforced at practice level (e.g. through internal appraisal) rather than via a central NHS credentialing body.

# High- vs Low-Performing Practice Features

Studies identify key differences between well-performing and struggling practices:

- **Staffing levels & GP type:** Practices with more **partner GPs** (versus locums or salaried clinicians) tend to score higher on patient satisfaction【23†L211-L215】.  Partners are often more experienced and invested in continuity of care. In contrast, underperforming practices often have higher reliance on short-term GPs or a single overworked doctor.
- **Patient list size:** Overlarge lists without extra staff predict problems.  In highly deprived areas, GPs carry \~300 more patients each than those in affluent areas【22†L274-L282】, contributing to lower quality scores and access problems. Funding formulas partly offset need, but on average deprived-area practices have \~7% *less* funding per need-adjusted patient than affluent ones【22†L278-L281】.
- **Appointment processes:** High-performing surgeries tend to offer multiple access routes (phone, e-consult, web booking, some drop-in slots) and invest in administrative staffing.  Low-performing ones often impose rigid triage or “digital-only” systems that patients find off-putting.
- **Continuity of care:** Practices that preserve patient-GP continuity (e.g. “book my usual GP” schemes) earn higher satisfaction. Practices with frequent doctor turnover or where patients “never see the same GP twice” often rank poorly.
- **Operations:** Efficient practices use recall systems (e.g. for chronic disease reviews) and have buffer capacity to avoid excessive waits. Underperforming practices may have chronic overbooking or punitive no-show policies (which can worsen access for the vulnerable).

Data from the CQC (via analysis) show \~90% of practices are rated “Good” overall【91†L79-L83】, about 8% “Outstanding” and \~5% “Requires Improvement” or “Inadequate”【91†L76-L83】.  The 5% rated below standard often have multiple fails in access and leadership domains.  Case reports from *“Inadequate”* practices frequently cite poor communication, low GP staffing, and overloaded reception.

# COVID-19 Pandemic and Digital Shift

The pandemic dramatically reshaped GP access:

- **Rise of remote care:** F2F appointments plummeted (to <10% in early 2020) and then recovered to \~63% by mid-2025【22†L238-L243】.  Telephone triage and video consults surged. NHS targets (“digital first by 2023/24”) and safety needs have entrenched mixed-mode access.  For example, at COVID peaks >50–60% of all GP contacts were remote【63†L200-L205】. Even after restrictions eased, remote consultations remain \~40% of total.
- **Increased demand:** Many patients deferred care during lockdowns.  Post-pandemic there was a rebound: total appointment volume is \~20–25% higher than 2019【4†L281-L284】.  A recent BMA report noted **370m GP appointments/year (England)** – up from 300m in 2019【4†L281-L284】.  GP practices report that since 2020 they have struggled to “get back to normal” access due to backlog and greater patient complexity.
- **Patient behavior:** As noted above, a much larger share of patients now *attempt* to contact their GP.  In 2023, 76.6% of patients had tried to make an appointment in the last 6 months (vs \~62.5% in 2021)【68†L209-L212】, indicating pent-up demand.  However, satisfaction with access has fallen – for instance, only \~50% find phone contact easy (vs \~81% in 2012)【68†L198-L201】.
- **Digital-first issues:** While online tools (NHS App, web triage) offer convenience, they have also created new barriers: older patients may be excluded, and there is a learning curve.  National guidance still requires practices to provide non-digital routes (e.g. phone).  Anecdotally, many local complaints cite difficulties with online form rejections, repetitive health questionnaires, or lack of clarity on how to secure an appointment – all fallout from rapid digitalization.

# Practice Management Companies and Providers

Some Manchester GP practices are run by third-party providers.  For example, **Better Health MCR** (a local social enterprise) ran two inner-city Manchester practices as a not-for-profit focusing on underserved areas【86†L27-L30】.  **GTD Healthcare** (a private provider) operates several practices in the region under NHS contracts.  The performance of these operators can vary: some emphasize extended hours and e-consult innovations, while others have been criticised (in national media) for overly stringent triage.  For instance, New Bank Health Centre in Longsight was operated by Better Health MCR under a fixed-term contract; in 2025 the contract passed to GTD (GoToDoc) after review.

Comparisons of provider types suggest that social-enterprise or GP-partner-led models often score higher on patient trust, whereas corporately-managed networks must guard against profit-driven cost-cutting.  In general, the best practices (whether corporate or independent) invest in enough reception/admin staff and avoid hiring only “remote” GPs.  Commissioners now sometimes compare providers on metrics like waiting times and patient feedback when awarding contracts.  Notably, Better Health MCR highlights that it reinvests surplus “for the benefit of our community, team and patients”【86†L27-L30】 – a model aimed at reducing health inequalities – whereas commercial chains may have different incentives.

# Summary of Benchmarks

- **Practice list size:** \~10,000–11,000 patients (national average).  In Manchester, practices range widely (smallest \~1,900, largest \~28,000【29†L369-L374】).
- **GP-to-patient ratio:** \~1 GP per 2,250 patients nationally【23†L184-L189】; in deprived Manchester areas, \~1 per 2,300【24†L131-L134】.
- **Appointments (per GP):** \~4,500/year (≈18/day)【4†L215-L218】.  Practices deliver \~25,400 GP-led appts/year each【4†L281-L284】.  Practices as a whole handle \~50–60k total appts/year.
- **Work hours:** Median GP contracted \~26 hours/week【51†L352-L360】, though true working time is higher due to admin.  Many GPs report 50+ hour weeks including extra work【40†L189-L194】【54†L104-L113】.
- **Satisfaction (GPPS):** 71% rate their GP practice “good” overall【68†L193-L201】; ≈93% trust their clinician【68†L218-L222】; only \~50% find phone access easy【68†L198-L201】.
- **Admin burden:** Estimated clinical:admin ratio \~3:1【46†L506-L509】.  Over 75% of GPs do unpaid extra admin/clerical work weekly【40†L189-L194】.
- **Missed appointments:** \~10% DNA nationally (7.2m/year in 2019)【63†L174-L182】; lower now with triage.

These benchmarks place New Bank Health Centre’s issues in context: it serves a high-need area (Longsight) where pressures mirror national trends (rising list size, heavy phone demand).  Many of its patient complaints (difficult phone contact, restrictive booking policies) are common across under-resourced urban practices.  Conversely, “high-performing” practices in similar areas often mitigate this by offering multiple access channels, ensuring sufficient admin staff, and preserving continuity, which could inform improvement efforts.

**Sources:** Official NHS data and surveys【23†L184-L189】【7†L531-L536】【4†L281-L284】【68†L193-L201】, peer-reviewed studies【46†L506-L509】【40†L189-L194】【51†L352-L360】, and independent analyses【22†L274-L282】【91†L76-L83】. These reflect the current (2022–25) landscape of UK GP practices.

- England average = \~2,257 patients per full-time equivalent (FTE) GP .
- Greater Manchester (Dec 2022) had \~3.25 m patients with \~1,418 FTE GPs (≈2,291 patients per GP) – worse ratios than the national average .
- Manchester City PCNs range from \~1,900 to 28,000 patients per practice list, with an average of \~10–12,000 .

### Appointment volumes & GP workload

- NHS England delivered \~367 m GP appointments in 2023/24 (22.5% higher than 2019) .
- \~176 m (44%) of these were GP-delivered appointments .
- Each practice provides \~25,400 GP appointments per year (≈2,120 per month) .
- Each GP provides \~4,500–6,200 patient contacts per year (\~18–30 per day)  .
- Contractual standard: 75 appointments per 1,000 patients per week (≈170 appointments weekly for a 2,250-patient GP list) .
- Surveys show many GPs work \~11-hour days, seeing \~35–40 patients per day, above safe workload levels .
- GPs spend \~25% of time on admin (letters, prescriptions, results, referrals) beyond clinical work, often unpaid extra sessions  .

### Patient access & missed appointments

- Since COVID, demand for GP care rose by \~20–25% above pre-pandemic levels .
- By mid-2025, \~63% of appointments were face-to-face and \~37% remote  .
- Only \~50% of patients find it easy to get through on the phone (down from 81% in 2012) .
- Only 54% rated appointment booking as a good experience (GP Patient Survey 2023) .
- \~28% of patients avoided making an appointment because it was too difficult .
- Around 7 m GP appointments were missed in 2019 (\~10%) ; rigid digital triage policies may under-report or misclassify demand and contribute to patient frustration.

### Patient satisfaction & feedback

- Nationally, 71% rated overall GP experience “good” in 2023 (down from 72% in 2022) .
- 93% had confidence/trust in their last GP; 91% said needs were met .
- Manchester and other deprived urban areas score worse than average, often due to **high demand, lower GP-to-patient ratios, and access barriers**.

### Admin & receptionist role

- Reception/admin staff handle calls, manage online triage (PATCHS, NHS App), process referrals and prescriptions, and coordinate chronic disease reviews.
- National GP survey shows \~80–90% of patients rate reception staff as “helpful,” but online and local reviews often highlight **rudeness, lack of compassion, poor communication, and gatekeeping behaviour**.
- Receptionists face high stress from call volumes and enforcing restrictive booking rules, which may contribute to negative interactions.

### Training & standards

- No national qualification for GP receptionists; mandatory training covers safeguarding, health & safety, infection control, equality & diversity, and data protection .
- “Training” is often used as a catch-all response to complaints, but many issues relate to **burnout, system design, and lack of staff agency**, not just knowledge gaps【33†L159-L167】.
- Best practice includes ongoing supervision, clear escalation processes, and measuring whether interventions improve patient outcomes.

### Provider differences & performance spread

- Around 90% of GP practices in England are rated “Good” by CQC; \~8% “Outstanding,” \~5% “Requires Improvement/Inadequate” .
- GTD Healthcare runs 13 GP practices in Greater Manchester/Tameside plus urgent care sites【37†L232-L239】. Most of their practices have **very low Google ratings (1.7–2.2★)**, with common issues:
  - **Hard to get appointments** (especially 8 am call queues and closed online forms).
  - **Rude or unhelpful reception staff**.
  - **Lost prescriptions or test results**.
  - **Lack of continuity of care due to reliance on locums**.
- **The Smithy Surgery (Hyde) performs best (\~3.9★)**, with patients praising continuity and helpful staff【36†source】.
- **Mossley Medical Practice (\~3★, CQC “Good”)** also fares better than GTD’s urban sites【36†source】.
- Other GTD practices (e.g. Droylsden 1.7★, Gordon Street 1.7★, Guide Bridge 1.8★, New Bank 2.1★) are among the **worst-rated in Greater Manchester**, aligning with national survey data showing poor access in deprived urban areas【36†source】.

✅ This version strips out commentary and leaves you with concise, evidence-based statements to reference in your meeting.

Would you like me to merge this into your **existing PPG notes pack** (with your points, reviews, and the “training challenge” doc), so you have a single briefing document ready to take tomorrow?
