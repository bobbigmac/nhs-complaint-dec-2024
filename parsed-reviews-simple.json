If the patient does not pick up on the first call, our policy is that the clinician will try them again no earlier than ten minutes later. If the patient still does not pick up, they will be asked to re-book an appointment for the following day. Whilst we understand your frustration, our practice has hundreds of patients who need our help each and every day, and we are not able to continuously call patients until they pick up. The only other circumstance that we allow our team to put the phone down on a patient is if they are being verbally abusive or aggressive. If none of these scenarios fit with your experience please do let me know by filling out a feedback form on our website and I will happily look into this for you.

      "text": "Hello George. Thank you for your review, we appreciate any reviews we receive whether they be positive or negative. We do understand that not all patients have internet access. That is why we have policies in place to offer further support to those who are digitally excluded, like taking appointment requests over the telephone etc. We appreciate that we do function a little bit differently here at New Bank Health Centre by operating a telephone triage system. This telephone triage system means that all patients will receive a phone call first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation. If you feel like you can no longer be a patient at our practice we do understand. To find a new GP practice, simply visit the NHS website. There you can search for a GP surgery using your postcode.

And then you sit until next day in pain without medication. …More a month ago If I could give zero stars, I would! This GP is so shameless, that they have now even time-limited sending admin requests and sick notes as well. Just like the appointments. They are open from 8am to hardly 10am or 11am. Who makes them think that we are available during those times when someone is sick or at work or commuting?? Instead of making it easy for sick patients to book appointments and requests at their convenience, they stress you out more, make you more anxious and sick. Horrible management! In Liverpool and London, almost all GPs have open appointment systems, you can book appointments online and choose your date and time. Admin requests, medical reports and sick notes are processed within 48 hours no questions asked and they even deliver medication to your house! But look at these guys, they are operating on biblical systems and it is 2025!! Do yourselves a favour and please open up your booking systems. Its not that hard. Stop being so shameless! I will be reporting this GP to Health Ombudsman, NHS and MP.",

Here at New Bank Health Centre, we operate a telephone triage policy. That means that every patient will get a telephone consultation first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you or your son have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation. This is a nationally accepted way of working that many other practices in the UK use. We offer in-person blood test appointments at the practice every working day of the week. The only time we would offer appointments for patients at a different practice, would be if a patient isn’t able to attend during normal surgery hours, or if the next appointment that was available was in our Enhanced Access hours (6-8pm Monday – Friday and 9am-5pm on Saturdays at The Robert Darbishire Practice) so I am afraid I have to disagree with your point that we always send patients to other practices.

Our intention is not to make anyone feel unheard or dismissed, and is instead to offer a caring and compassionate service.

Usually, we would only direct patients to use the services of a walk-in centre or NHS 111 if we did not have any appointments left and a patient felt like they needed to be seen that day. If they could wait, we would usually ask them to contact us the following day to book an appointment. I haven't been able to look into this for you as I can't find you under the name used on your review in our system.

We’re saddened to hear you feel we’re a terrible GP Practice and that our staff “don’t want to work.” Please let me assure you that’s not the case. I apologise for taking a bit more time than usual to respond to your review. I did want to take a look into what happened so I can offer further information for you. I can completely understand your frustration about being passed over to pharmacy and not being given a GP appointment. However, we are obliged to use the Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme (CPCS) mentioned in your review. The Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme is a new national service to facilitate patients having a same day appointment for minor illnesses, or to get an urgent supply of a repeat medication. The service is designed to help alleviate pressure on GP appointments and emergency departments and so more people are able to get treatment quickly. I understand you may feel that the doctors here at New Bank Health Centre are avoiding patients, but please let me reassure you that is not the case. This is a scheme that has been put in place by the Government, and we have been instructed to use it by both the Government and NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care, our governing body. Only specific pharmacies are involved in this scheme. This is why when you contacted Cohen’s pharmacy they said they were not responsible and when you visited them, they charged you for medication. Unfortunately, due to this being a public forum, I’m unable to give more details as it would breach confidentiality rules. Kind Regards, Lauren, Engagement & Communications Officer",

We do encourage patients who are able to use the internet to visit our website to fill in an online form. However, if a patient is unable to do so, we will fill in the form for them over the phone. Our reception team aren't able to book appointments and the online forms get assigned to the appropriate clinician. Unfortunately, our appointments are booked incredibly quickly, usually within the first few hours of the day, so if patients submit forms later on in the afternoon, it is unlikely we will be able to give them an appointment. We are a same day service and are unable to book appointments in advance. I’m afraid due to confidentiality laws, I am unable to respond on here to specific parts of your complaint. To do so would breach your medical confidentiality. If you would like me to look further into this incident for you, please do fill in a feedback form.

When it comes to the telephone, it is a first come first served system and unfortunately, we cannot control how many people call the surgery and how long the wait will be on the phone. Our team strive to get through the calls as quickly as possible, but sometimes the wait for patients will still be longer than everyone would like. It's a shame you feel that your tax money is being used for useless clinics and doctors. We feel we're a vital asset within the community and always help patients the best way we can and as quickly as we can. We try to accommodate everyone and give every patient who needs it an appointment, but we do have a limit that is very often reached from early in the morning - this includes emergency appointments. With that being said, I would be happy to take a look into this situation for you, and to get to the bottom of exactly what was said and why you weren't given an appointment that day.

The level of care and professionalism is shockingly poor, and I’m genuinely appalled by the way patients are treated. The staff are not only unhelpful but often rude and dismissive, making it incredibly difficult to get even the most basic appointment advice or simply book one. Trying to book an appointment is an absolute nightmare. Instead of making things easier for unwell patients, the process adds stress, anxiety, and frustration. You’re passed between phone lines, broken websites, and conflicting instructions; and still end up with no appointment. It feels like no one takes responsibility, and the entire system is set up to discourage people from accessing care. Terrible experience, awful management. This practice desperately needs a complete overhaul.",
