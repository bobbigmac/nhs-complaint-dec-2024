# GP Practice Complaint: Digital Access Issues - December 2024

## **CORE ISSUES**
- **Digital-only booking system** - no phone/in-person options
- **Unscheduled callbacks** - patients wait all day with no timeframe
- **Two-strikes deletion policy** - missed calls = deleted requests
- **No same-day resubmission** - must wait until next day
- **Misleading terminology** - "missed appointments" for unscheduled calls
- **Tiny text fields** for lengthy medical information 
- **Poor notifications** - requests deleted without warning

## **IMPACT ON PATIENTS**
- **Vulnerable groups excluded** (elderly, disabled, digitally excluded)
- **Patient safety risks** - delays in care access
- **Mental health impact** - uncertainty and anxiety
- **Time wasted** - all-day waiting for uncertain outcomes
- **Statistical misrepresentation** - inflates "missed appointment" figures

## **EVIDENCE FROM REVIEWS**
- **40+ complaints** about appointment system since 2017
- **Average rating 1.5/5** for appointment-related complaints
- **Consistent themes**: long phone waits, confusing digital system, rude staff
- **Pattern**: Better Health MCR management (post-2017) shows significant decline

## **NHS POLICY VIOLATIONS**
- **Patient communication standards** - unclear notifications
- **Accessibility requirements** - no alternative booking methods
- **Data accuracy** - mischaracterizing missed calls as appointments
- **Patient rights** - equitable access not provided

## **ESCALATION PATH**
1. **Practice Manager** (direct complaint)
2. **Healthwatch Manchester** (0300 078 0669)
3. **NHS England** (0300 311 22 33)
4. **NHS Counter Fraud Authority** (if intentional misrepresentation suspected)

## **PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**
- **No Deletion** The patient didn't magically get better, they asked for your help, and you deleted them, in many cases with a shirty victim-blaming message.
- **Alternative booking methods** (phone/in-person)
- **Scheduled callback windows** instead of all-day waiting
- **Flexible missed call policy** - allow same-day resubmission
- **Clear notifications** when requests are closed
- **Accurate terminology** - don't call unscheduled calls "appointments"

## **BROADER IMPLICATIONS**
- **Systemic issue** - the doctors might be great, but some patients don't get the chance to find out
- **Potential fraud** - inflated missed appointment statistics
- **Public interest** - worth investigating across Manchester practices
- **Journalistic angle** - could escalate to Manchester Mill/Post
