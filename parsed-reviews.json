We're passionate about helping our community with their health so it is disappointing that you don't feel we're reaching that goal. We're always happy to take patient feedback on board. If you're looking to help us make improvements, the best way to do that is to join our Patient Participation Group. They are a group of people who are patients of the surgery and want to help it work as well as it can for patients, doctors and staff. They get together to bring different ideas to the surgery to help us treat patients better or to improve what we do in some way.

      "text": "Hello Amina, I’m sorry to hear that your experience with our practice has not been great and you feel that our surgery should be shut down. Here at New Bank Health Centre, we operate a telephone triage policy. That means that every patient will get a telephone consultation first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you or your son have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation. This is a nationally accepted way of working that many other practices in the UK use. We offer in-person blood test appointments at the practice every working day of the week. The only time we would offer appointments for patients at a different practice, would be if a patient isn’t able to attend during normal surgery hours, or if the next appointment that was available was in our Enhanced Access hours (6-8pm Monday – Friday and 9am-5pm on Saturdays at The Robert Darbishire Practice) so I am afraid I have to disagree with your point that we always send patients to other practices. I am however very concerned about your son not being able to get his vaccinations and would like to look into this further for you.

Regarding our receptionists, we can assure you that they do not hold our doctors to ransom. Our reception team are highly trained to deal with and triage patient requests, so they are passed over to the correct clinician or staff member. This in turn makes sure that the request is dealt with appropriately, and that each medical professional has all the information they need before the appointment so they can spend all the time in the consultation helping them.",

We do encourage patients who are able to use the internet to visit our website to fill in an online form. However, if a patient is unable to do so, we will fill in the form for them over the phone. Our reception team aren't able to book appointments and the online forms get assigned to the appropriate clinician. Unfortunately, our appointments are booked incredibly quickly, usually within the first few hours of the day, so if patients submit forms later on in the afternoon, it is unlikely we will be able to give them an appointment. We are a same day service and are unable to book appointments in advance. I’m afraid due to confidentiality laws, I am unable to respond on here to specific parts of your complaint.

We’re saddened to hear you feel we’re a terrible GP Practice and that our staff “don’t want to work.” Please let me assure you that’s not the case. I apologise for taking a bit more time than usual to respond to your review. I did want to take a look into what happened so I can offer further information for you. I can completely understand your frustration about being passed over to pharmacy and not being given a GP appointment. However, we are obliged to use the Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme (CPCS) mentioned in your review. The Community Pharmacy Consultation Scheme is a new national service to facilitate patients having a same day appointment for minor illnesses, or to get an urgent supply of a repeat medication. The service is designed to help alleviate pressure on GP appointments and emergency departments and so more people are able to get treatment quickly. I understand you may feel that the doctors here at New Bank Health Centre are avoiding patients, but please let me reassure you that is not the case. This is a scheme that has been put in place by the Government, and we have been instructed to use it by both the Government and NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care, our governing body. Only specific pharmacies are involved in this scheme. This is why when you contacted Cohen’s pharmacy they said they were not responsible and when you visited them, they charged you for medication. Unfortunately, due to this being a public forum, I’m unable to give more details as it would breach confidentiality rules.",

Instead of making it easy for sick patients to book appointments and requests at their convenience, they stress you out more, make you more anxious and sick. Horrible management! In Liverpool and London, almost all GPs have open appointment systems, you can book appointments online and choose your date and time. Admin requests, medical reports and sick notes are processed within 48 hours no questions asked and they even deliver medication to your house! But look at these guys, they are operating on biblical systems and it is 2025!! Do yourselves a favour and please open up your booking systems. Its not that hard. Stop being so shameless!

That is why we have policies in place to offer further support to those who are digitally excluded, like taking appointment requests over the telephone etc. We appreciate that we do function a little bit differently here at New Bank Health Centre by operating a telephone triage system. This telephone triage system means that all patients will receive a phone call first, and if it is deemed necessary by the doctor, they will then be offered a face-to-face appointment at the practice. Although this way of working may not be preferable for all patients, we have often found that it is successful and allows patients to get the treatment they need from the comfort of their own home. If you have not been brought in to see the doctor in the surgery, this will have meant that they felt they could get a diagnosis of your medical problems and give you the treatment you need through the phone conversation. If you feel like you can no longer be a patient at our practice we do understand. To find a new GP practice, simply visit the NHS website. There you can search for a GP surgery using your postcode.",

Whilst we understand your frustration, our practice has hundreds of patients who need our help each and every day, and we are not able to continuously call patients until they pick up.

We're sorry you feel you have to be close to death to get an appointment with us, and that you need to try every day for a month to get seen. We do offer appointments on a first come first served basis as we find that is the fairest way. Unfortunately, we have seen an increase in appointment requests which may make it more difficult to get an appointment. I have passed your feedback onto our executive team to see if there are measures that can be put in place to make it easier to get an appointment with us.
