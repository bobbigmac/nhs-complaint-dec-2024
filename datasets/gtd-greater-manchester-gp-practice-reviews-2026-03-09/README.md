- non-GTD nearby rows: 66

Caveats:

- Google review fields are partial. They were only populated when a high-confidence public mirror match could be identified.
- Trustpilot fields are blank in this run because a reliable per-practice public source was not found.
- GTD's Lindley Medical Practice was matched to the NHS profile currently published as `Lindley House Health Centre` at the same Oldham site.
