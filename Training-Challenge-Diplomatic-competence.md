**A Diplomatic Training Challenge: For Management**



Welcome — this short worksheet is here to help us discuss patient concerns clearly and constructively. The tone is kind and practical: name things honestly, then choose fixes that work.


**Learning Objective**
By the end of this module, managers will be able to:

- Recognise the risks of reframing serious complaints as “training challenges.”
- Avoid prescribing “easy” solutions without first identifying root causes.
- Demonstrate honesty in language to support meaningful change.

**Background**
Recent patient participation meetings have highlighted concerns about staff *incompetence*. When summarised diplomatically as *“training challenges”*, these issues risk being misrepresented and therefore mis-solved.

**Case Study**

- Patient complaint: “Staff are incompetent.”
- Management summary: “We face training challenges.”
- Standard solution: Issue refresher PDFs or brief training sessions.
- Result: Appearance of improvement; no measurement of actual change.

**Root Cause Analysis**
Some Possible causes of staff behaviour:

- Burnout from prolonged pressures (e.g., five years of pandemic).
- Depression, disengagement, or loss of agency in the workplace.
- Structural constraints leaving staff unable to help patients, leading to avoidance behaviours (silence, hanging up, labelling patients as “problematic”).
- Not simply lack of knowledge or skill.

**Learning Checkpoint**
Q: Which of the following can be solved with training PDFs?
a) Forgetting how to use a system function
b) Being exhausted and disengaged after years of impossible workloads
c) Aggressive silence on patient calls
d) A lack of clear authority or agency within the practice
e) Frustration with troubled patients and ejecting them instead of helping them
f) An absence of ongoing support from senior and similarly stressed staff

(Answer: a)

**Key Takeaway**
Reframing incompetence as a “training challenge” minimises the issue and prescribes inadequate solutions. Management must ensure that language reflects reality, so that solutions can address root causes, not appearances.

**Next Steps for Managers**

- Resist diplomatic minimisation when recording patient concerns.
- Link solutions explicitly to original complaints.
- Measure whether implemented solutions change patient outcomes.

I hope this is received with the positive intent with which it was written.

When patients describe staff as *incompetent*, reframing that as a *“training challenge”* is more than just diplomatic language. It prescribes a solution before investigating the cause. 

Training can fix a lack of knowledge or skill, but it cannot fix disengagement, burnout, depression, or a system that leaves staff powerless to help and tired of trying.

Issuing a PDF refresher course or a quick workshop may look like progress, but it risks being theatre: a visible “solution” that papers over the complaint while leaving the underlying problem untouched. Staff who ignore patients, hang up, or label people as “problematic” are not simply untrained — they are reacting to the constraints of the system around them.

The danger of minimising the language is that it also minimises accountability. If the issue is called a “challenge,” then the solution can be box-ticked, even if nothing changes for patients. If the issue is named honestly, the solutions become harder — but also more meaningful.

The **You said, We Did** one-off report pdf from May 2019 (best I can tell), shows a similar pattern of issuing training as a result of complaints, but no evidence of follow-up to confirm that complaint was resolved by a change in behaviour. Meanwhile, complaints and negative reviews continue. That’s the risk of leaning too heavily on diplomatic framing — it encourages cheap solutions that look solved, but aren’t.

Your organisation took action, but didn't check if it was effective. If the goal is real improvement, the language we use has to reflect the seriousness of the issues raised.
