### New Bank Health Centre Patient Survey Summary

The document provided is a detailed report on patient satisfaction with the New Bank Health Centre GP practice, focusing on metrics such as ease of contact, appointment experiences, and overall satisfaction. 

#### Key Failure Areas Impacting Access

1. **Difficulty in Contacting the Practice**
   - **Phone Contact:**
     - **Failure Rate:** 39% of patients do not find it easy to get through to the practice by phone.
     - **Breakdown:** 
       - 10% find it fairly difficult.
       - 12% find it very difficult.
       - 18% are neutral, which may also suggest dissatisfaction.
     - **Comparison:** This is better than the national average (47% do not find it easy), but 39% is still a substantial barrier.
   - **Website Contact:**
     - **Failure Rate:** 27% do not find it easy to contact the practice via the website.
     - **Breakdown:** 
       - 10% find it fairly difficult.
       - 8% find it very difficult.
       - 9% are neutral.
     - **Comparison:** Outperforms the national average (49% do not find it easy), yet 27% still struggle.
   - **NHS App Contact:**
     - **Failure Rate:** 40% do not find it easy to contact the practice using the NHS App.
     - **Breakdown:** 
       - 10% find it fairly difficult.
       - 18% find it very difficult.
       - 11% are neutral.
     - **Comparison:** Better than the national average (51% do not find it easy), but 40% is a high failure rate.
   - **Impact:** These initial contact methods are critical gateways to care. With 39% struggling by phone, 27% via the website, and 40% via the NHS App, a significant portion of patients face barriers before they can even request an appointment. This likely discourages or prevents many from accessing services altogether.

2. **Lack of Clarity After Contact**
   - **Failure Rate:** 25% of patients did not know what the next step would be after contacting the practice (75% knew).
   - **Breakdown:** 
     - 12% explicitly said "no."
     - 13% were told to contact the practice again another day, indicating inefficiency.
   - **Comparison:** Worse than the national average (17% do not know).
   - **Impact:** A quarter of patients leaving without clear guidance may delay care or give up, especially if they must repeatedly attempt contact. This inefficiency exacerbates access issues.

3. **Poor Experience in Contacting the Practice**
   - **Failure Rate:** 34% do not describe their experience of contacting the practice as good (66% say it’s good).
   - **Breakdown:** 
     - 17% rate it as neither good nor poor.
     - 7% as fairly poor.
     - 10% as very poor.
   - **Comparison:** Worse than the national average (30% do not rate it as good).
   - **Impact:** A third of patients having a subpar contact experience reflects systemic issues in responsiveness, potentially deterring future attempts to access care.

4. **Limited Choice in Appointments**
   - **Failure Rate:** 
     - 34% were not offered a choice of time or day.
     - 89% were not offered a choice of location (11% were offered this choice).
   - **Comparison:** 
     - Time/day choice is better than the national average (46% not offered).
     - Location choice is worse (86% not offered nationally).
   - **Impact:** Lack of flexibility in scheduling can prevent patients from attending appointments that fit their availability or location preferences, creating another barrier to access.

5. **Excessive Wait Times**
   - **Failure Rate:** 35% felt they waited too long for their last appointment (65% felt it was about right).
   - **Comparison:** Slightly worse than the national average (33% felt it took too long).
   - **Impact:** Long wait times can discourage timely care-seeking, particularly for urgent needs, and may lead some to abandon the process.

6. **Inadequate Support for Long-Term Conditions**
   - **Failure Rate:** 39% of patients with long-term conditions say they have not had enough support from local services in the past 12 months (61% say they have).
   - **Comparison:** Worse than the national average (31% say no).
   - **Impact:** This high failure rate suggests a gap in ongoing care, which is critical for managing chronic conditions and maintaining patient engagement with the practice.

7. **Overall Experience**
   - **Failure Rate:** 31% do not describe their overall experience as good (69% say it’s good).
   - **Breakdown:** 
     - 9% rate it as neither good nor poor.
     - 12% as fairly poor.
     - 10% as very poor.
   - **Comparison:** Worse than the national average (25% do not rate it as good).
   - **Impact:** Nearly a third of patients being dissatisfied reflects the cumulative effect of accessibility and service issues, likely reducing trust and willingness to seek care.

#### Critical Oversight: The 40% Driven Away

The survey only includes patients who have successfully contacted or had appointments with the practice, excluding those who couldn’t get through or gave up due to initial barriers. This methodological flaw means the reported failure rates (e.g., 39% for phone, 40% for NHS App) likely underestimate the true extent of access problems. 

The people they’re driving away are not measured, suggesting that the practice’s accessibility failures could be significantly worse than the data indicates (running local numbers suggests a range 800-1200 patients affected). These unrepresented patients are likely the most affected by the practice’s shortcomings in contact methods and responsiveness.

#### Comparison to Local and National Averages

While the practice often performs better than local (ICS) and national averages, this does not mitigate the absolute scale of its failures:
- **Phone Contact:** 39% vs. 47% nationally (still a large group struggling).
- **Website Contact:** 27% vs. 49% nationally (still over a quarter failing).
- **NHS App Contact:** 40% vs. 51% nationally (still two-fifths facing issues).
Better-than-average performance does not excuse the fact that substantial minorities are unable to access services easily. The focus on relative success masks the real-world impact on patients.

#### Later Stages vs. Initial Access

The data shows higher satisfaction in later stages (e.g., 74%-87% for appointment quality metrics like listening and care), with failure rates ranging from 13% to 30%. This suggests that once patients overcome initial barriers, their experience improves. However, the critical failure lies in getting to that stage:
- **Implication:** The practice is losing people at the entry point, and the survey’s focus on later-stage satisfaction obscures the significant drop-off before care is received.

### Conclusion

The GP practice is failing a substantial portion of its patients in accessing services, with 39% struggling to contact by phone, 27% via the website, and 40% via the NHS App. Additional barriers include 34% not getting a choice of appointment time/day, 89% not getting a location choice, and 35% facing long wait times. The 39% lacking support for long-term conditions and 31% dissatisfied overall further highlight systemic issues. 

Most critically, the survey excludes the 40% of patients potentially driven away by these initial hurdles, meaning the true failure rate is likely higher. While the practice outperforms some averages, its absolute failure rates reveal significant accessibility barriers that prevent many from receiving care. To address this, the practice must prioritize improving contact methods, clarity, and flexibility to ensure all patients can access services effectively.
