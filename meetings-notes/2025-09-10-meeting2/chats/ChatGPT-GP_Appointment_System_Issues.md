# GP Appointment System Issues

#### You:
[Unsupported Content]

#### You:
I'm conflicted, help me respond appropriately.
I registered with a new GP surgery in the UK (Manchester, New Bank Health Centre) and tried to request an appointment, they're digital-only, you can't even make an appointment in person or via phone, only online via a form that has tiny text fields, but requires quite a lot of text, which is sent to a doctor who may or may not call the requestor, it says on the same day, so the patient is waiting all day and may not even receive a call. Text messages are sent to the patient for some replies, but not all, and the ticket can be closed and deleted by a receptionist, with no notification sent, so the patient may not even know their request was deleted, never receieve a call and have no idea why. 
How bad is this? Across uk NHS providers is this normal? as a patient, this seems awful, but I need a sense for how much I can expect complaining to help, or whether I should just suck it up?

#### ChatGPT:
Your experience highlights some serious issues that are unfortunately becoming more common in NHS primary care, but it's worth dissecting to give you clarity and help you respond appropriately.

### How bad is this?

1. **Limited access to booking mechanisms**: Forcing digital-only access is problematic, especially for patients who struggle with technology or have limited internet access. This approach risks excluding vulnerable groups, including the elderly or disabled.

2. **Tiny text fields for lengthy responses**: This is user-unfriendly and shows a lack of empathy for patient needs. It makes the process harder than necessary, especially for patients already stressed or unwell.

3. **Waiting all day for uncertain outcomes**: Leaving patients waiting for a callback without a specific timeframe undermines trust and creates significant anxiety. This approach is inefficient and fails to respect patients' time.

4. **Lack of transparency with ticket closures**: Closing requests without notifying the patient is unacceptable. Patients are entitled to know the status of their requests and the reasons for any closures.

5. **Communication inconsistencies**: Mixing text messages with other methods for critical updates creates confusion. Patients may miss important information or misunderstand the process.

### Is this normal across the UK?

- **Increasingly common**: Many GP surgeries are adopting digital triage systems to manage demand, driven by chronic underfunding and workforce shortages in the NHS. However, the quality of implementation varies greatly.
- **Good practice exists**: Better systems notify patients at every step, provide clear callback windows, and offer alternate access methods (e.g., phone for those unable to go online).
- **Not universal**: Some surgeries still allow in-person or phone appointments, though these are becoming less common in high-demand areas.

### Should you complain?

Yes, but do so constructively. Complaints can lead to improvements, especially if multiple patients raise similar concerns. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Be specific**: Highlight the issues clearly, e.g., the lack of alternate booking methods, poor communication, and the impact on patients (stress, wasted time, exclusion of vulnerable groups).

2. **Frame it positively**: Suggest solutions, such as:
   - Offering a phone option for booking or urgent queries.
   - Improving digital form usability (e.g., larger text boxes, clearer guidance).
   - Sending automated updates when tickets are closed.
   - Providing callback time windows to avoid all-day waiting.

3. **Escalate if necessary**: If the practice doesn’t respond satisfactorily, you can escalate your complaint to NHS England or your local Healthwatch organization. They monitor GP services and can advocate for better standards.

4. **Consider alternatives**: If the system feels unworkable, you might explore other surgeries in your area that offer better access.

### Should you "suck it up"?

Not entirely. While the NHS is under immense pressure, patients have a right to accessible and respectful care. Addressing these concerns can benefit not just you but the wider patient community.


#### You:
I also wanted to clarify, that if the doctor calls the patient (twice in a short time window) and the patient doesn't answer, the request for a doctor is deleted. The user is informed, but has to create a new entry from scratch, entering all information, which they can only do on a different day. If they create a new request on the same day, even if the first call is missed early in the day, the new request is deleted without being actioned at all, and in my case, no notification was sent, I had to check the initial 'new ticket' notification for a link to go and read the thread to discover it had been closed.

Another issue is that deleted ticket in text that appeared to have been a form response said "As you have missed an appointment already today, you must wait for another day", but I'd argue I didn't miss an appointment, as the possibility of a call was unscheduled, it doesn't qualify as an 'appointment' that I missed, just a call.

#### ChatGPT:
Your clarification adds significant weight to the issues you're raising, as it highlights systemic flaws that impact both fairness and patient care. Here's a breakdown of the added concerns and how you might address them:

### Additional Problems

1. **Punitive handling of missed calls**:
   - The policy of deleting a request if a patient misses two unscheduled calls is harsh and inflexible. Patients might not be able to answer immediately due to work, childcare, or simply being away from their phone for a moment.
   - The inability to create a new request on the same day adds further rigidity and could leave patients without care, even for urgent concerns.

2. **Mischaracterization of a missed call as a "missed appointment"**:
   - Referring to an unscheduled call as a "missed appointment" is misleading and unfair. An appointment implies a fixed time mutually agreed upon by both parties, which this clearly isn’t.
   - This language shifts blame onto patients, eroding trust and discouraging people from seeking care.

3. **Lack of timely notification about ticket closures**:
   - Requiring patients to actively check for updates rather than notifying them of ticket closures compounds confusion. Patients may lose valuable time, not realizing their requests have been closed.

4. **Barriers to resubmitting requests**:
   - Making patients re-enter all information from scratch the next day is unnecessarily burdensome. It shows a lack of consideration for the user experience, especially for those who may already be struggling with health issues.

### Is this defensible under NHS norms?

- **Not best practice**: The system you’ve described does not align with patient-centered care principles, which emphasize accessibility, clarity, and respect for patient needs. Many NHS providers have moved to digital triage systems, but the better ones:
  - Allow callbacks at set times or give patients options to reschedule missed calls.
  - Provide detailed, timely notifications about ticket updates or closures.
  - Have robust fallback options for patients who miss initial contact.
- **Missed call policies**: While some surgeries close requests after missed calls, better systems allow patients to reopen cases the same day without starting from scratch.

### How to frame your complaint effectively

When raising these issues, focus on how the system impacts patients and propose constructive solutions. Here's how you can structure your feedback:

1. **Summarize the issues**:
   - The rigidity of the missed call policy and its consequences (deleted requests, inability to reapply the same day, and re-entering information).
   - Misleading language about "missed appointments," which unfairly shifts blame to patients.
   - Lack of timely notifications about ticket closures, forcing patients to track the system manually.

2. **Explain the impact**:
   - Highlight how these issues waste patients' time, increase stress, and potentially delay care for urgent needs.
   - Emphasize how the system excludes or disadvantages people with irregular schedules, disabilities, or limited digital access.

3. **Propose solutions**:
   - Allow patients to reopen missed-call requests the same day or at least resubmit easily without re-entering all information.
   - Stop referring to unscheduled calls as "appointments" to avoid confusion and blame.
   - Notify patients immediately when a ticket is closed, with clear reasons provided.
   - Offer scheduled callbacks or a broader callback window to give patients more flexibility.

4. **Emphasize fairness and patient safety**:
   - Point out that the current system disproportionately harms vulnerable groups and risks patient health by delaying care unnecessarily.

### Should you escalate this?

If the practice is unresponsive or dismissive, consider escalating your concerns:

- **Healthwatch**: They collect feedback on NHS services and can advocate for changes.
- **NHS England**: As the commissioning body, they oversee GP services and can intervene if a practice fails to meet standards.
- **Care Quality Commission (CQC)**: If the issues are severe, you can report the practice to the CQC, which inspects and regulates healthcare providers.

### Bottom Line

Your concerns are valid and worth addressing. While systemic NHS issues might limit immediate improvements, raising these issues constructively can push the practice toward more patient-centered policies and benefit others in your community.

**Subject**: Formal Complaint Regarding Appointment System at New Bank Health Centre

Dear \[Recipient's Name],

I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding the appointment system at New Bank Health Centre in Manchester. As a patient, I have encountered several issues that I believe compromise the quality of care and patient experience:

1. **Digital-Only Appointment Booking**: The exclusive reliance on an online form for appointment requests poses significant challenges, particularly for patients with limited digital access or proficiency.

2. **Inadequate Form Design**: The current online form requires extensive information input into small text fields, making the process cumbersome and user-unfriendly.

3. **Unscheduled Callbacks**: Patients are expected to remain available for a callback at any time during the day, without a specified timeframe, leading to prolonged periods of uncertainty and inconvenience.

4. **Handling of Missed Calls**: If a patient misses two calls in quick succession, their request is deleted, and they are required to submit a new request on a different day. This policy does not account for legitimate reasons a patient might be unavailable momentarily.

5. **Lack of Notification on Request Closure**: There have been instances where requests were closed without any notification to the patient, leaving them unaware of the status of their appointment.

6. **Mischaracterization of Missed Calls**: Labeling missed unscheduled calls as "missed appointments" is misleading, as no specific appointment time was agreed upon.

These practices not only hinder access to care but also contribute to patient frustration and potential deterioration of health conditions due to delays.

I respectfully request the following actions to address these concerns:

- **Implementation of Alternative Booking Methods**: Introduce options for in-person and telephone appointment bookings to accommodate all patients, including those without internet access.

- **Improvement of Online Form Usability**: Redesign the online form to ensure it is user-friendly, with appropriately sized text fields and clear instructions.

- **Scheduled Callback Windows**: Provide patients with specific time slots for callbacks to minimize disruptions and uncertainty.

- **Flexible Handling of Missed Calls**: Allow patients to reschedule missed calls within the same day without penalization or the need to submit a new request.

- **Transparent Communication**: Ensure that any closure of requests is promptly communicated to patients, with clear explanations provided.

- **Accurate Terminology**: Use appropriate language to describe missed communications, avoiding terms like "missed appointments" when no specific appointment was scheduled.

I believe these changes will significantly enhance patient satisfaction and ensure equitable access to healthcare services.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution that addresses these concerns.

Yours sincerely,

\[Your Name]

This template is designed to clearly and professionally convey your concerns, facilitating constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities.


#### You:
I am also concerned that because of an attitude towards introducing charging for missed appointments, this might be intentional to pad statistics of missed appointments, if not by the surgery themselves, by their management company (can you look up who runs this GP, I think it's a company that runs a few surgeries nearby), which might end up being fraud

#### ChatGPT:
Your concerns about the appointment system at New Bank Health Centre are valid, especially considering the potential for misrepresented statistics on missed appointments. The practice is managed by Better Health MCR, a not-for-profit limited company that oversees multiple practices in Manchester, including The Robert Darbishire Practice and The Whitswood Practice. citeturn0search0

The current system's design could inadvertently inflate missed appointment figures, particularly if unscheduled calls are labeled as "missed appointments." This misrepresentation could lead to unjustified penalties for patients and skewed data that might influence policy decisions, such as introducing charges for missed appointments.

To address these issues, consider the following steps:

1. **Direct Communication with Practice Management**: Engage with the practice manager to express your concerns about the appointment system and the potential misrepresentation of missed appointments. This initial step allows the practice to rectify any unintentional flaws in their system.

2. **Escalation to Oversight Bodies**: If the practice's response is unsatisfactory, escalate your concerns to Healthwatch Manchester and NHS England, as previously outlined. These organizations can investigate systemic issues and advocate for necessary changes.

3. **Reporting Potential Fraud**: If you suspect intentional manipulation of appointment statistics, report this to the NHS Counter Fraud Authority. They are responsible for investigating fraud within the NHS.

   - **Phone**: 0800 028 4060
   - **Online Reporting**: [NHS Counter Fraud Authority - Report Fraud](https://cfa.nhs.uk/reportfraud)

When communicating your concerns, provide specific examples and suggest constructive solutions, such as implementing scheduled appointment times and accurate terminology for missed communications. This approach not only highlights the issues but also demonstrates a willingness to collaborate towards improvement.

By following these steps, you can address the current challenges and contribute to enhancing the appointment system for all patients at New Bank Health Centre.


#### You:
Okay so let's assume I can walk in to the surgery and ask to speak with the practice manager, and let's assume they agree to meet me there and then (unlikely but possible, it's a small surgery), can you write an introduction to the problem and a set of questions I should ask to identify the scope and scale of this error, and whether it's simply bad local choices (say internal staff using bad tools to try and make a system that works) or real poor system/flow design/engineering that needs to be escalated.

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s how you can structure your discussion with the practice manager if you manage to meet them in person. This includes an introduction to frame the issue and a clear set of questions to identify the scope of the problem.

---

### **Introduction to the Problem**

Hello, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I wanted to raise some concerns about the appointment system at New Bank Health Centre and how it’s impacting patient access to care. I appreciate the pressure the NHS is under, but I’ve noticed some patterns in the way the system operates that seem to create unnecessary barriers for patients. These issues include:

1. **Digital-only booking system**: Many patients, especially those with limited access to or knowledge of technology, may struggle to use the online form.
2. **Missed calls policy**: Patients who miss two unscheduled calls have their requests deleted, which forces them to re-enter information and wait until another day to submit a new request.
3. **Unclear communication**: Patients are not always notified when their requests are closed, leaving them in the dark about the status of their care.
4. **Misrepresentation of missed calls**: Unscheduled calls are being labeled as "missed appointments," which doesn’t accurately reflect the nature of the interaction and could distort statistics.
5. **Inflexibility in the system**: The inability to submit a new request on the same day further delays access to care.

These issues raise questions about whether these are local challenges or if there’s a systemic design flaw that needs escalation. I’d like to better understand the reasoning behind these processes and what can be done to improve the system.

---

### **Key Questions to Identify Scope and Scale**

1. **About the System Design**:
   - What system or software is used to manage patient appointments and communications? Is it a locally developed system or part of a broader NHS framework?
   - Was the system custom-designed for your practice, or is it implemented across multiple surgeries managed by Better Health MCR?
   - Are there any plans to improve or redesign this system in the near future?

2. **Handling Missed Calls**:
   - What is the rationale behind labeling missed unscheduled calls as "missed appointments"? Has the impact of this terminology on patient trust and statistical accuracy been considered?
   - Why are patients required to wait until the next day to resubmit their requests? Is there a technical or policy-based reason for this restriction?

3. **Communication with Patients**:
   - How are patients notified about the closure of their requests? Why is there no automated system to alert patients when their request is deleted or resolved?
   - Are there any plans to improve the communication process to ensure patients are always informed of the status of their requests?

4. **Addressing Accessibility**:
   - What considerations have been made for patients who cannot use the digital system due to disability, lack of access, or technical difficulties?
   - Are there alternative booking options (e.g., telephone or in-person) for these groups?

5. **Impact on Missed Appointment Statistics**:
   - Are missed unscheduled calls included in the practice’s official statistics for missed appointments? If so, is this aligned with NHS definitions and reporting requirements?
   - How are these statistics used within the practice or reported to management? Are they linked to performance evaluations or policy decisions, such as charging for missed appointments?

6. **Feedback and Complaints**:
   - How do you collect and review patient feedback on the appointment system? Has similar feedback to mine been received, and how has it been addressed?
   - What is the best way for patients to escalate concerns about the system if they feel it is not meeting their needs?

7. **System Ownership and Management**:
   - Who is ultimately responsible for the design, maintenance, and oversight of the appointment system? Is it managed locally by the practice, by Better Health MCR, or by an external provider?
   - Are there any channels through which patients can provide direct feedback to the management company or system designers?

---

### **Next Steps**

Close the conversation by asking:

- "Based on what we’ve discussed, what steps are you planning to take to address these issues?"
- "Is there a way for me to stay informed about changes or improvements to the system?"

This approach demonstrates that you’re seeking to understand the root of the problem rather than simply complaining, while also holding the practice accountable for addressing your concerns.


#### You:
I don't want to get laughed out of the surgery (not literally, but ykwim) because I'm not a journalist (though I have written some news articles for industry press and occasional columns for graduate newspapers/magazines), but I do feel a responsibility to find out how many people are being affected by this, not just here but more broadly. A further escalation even if this one surgery improves its process, might be to examine the other surgeries in the area and elevate it to say Manchester Mill or Manchester Post (I'd suggest the Evening News but they're not good). I don't however want to be a thorn in anyone's side, I just want the systems to improve

#### ChatGPT:
Your approach is thoughtful and considerate, and it’s clear your intent isn’t to disrupt but to help improve systems that are currently creating unnecessary barriers for patients. Here's a plan that balances tact and responsibility while giving you avenues to escalate the issue constructively if needed:

---

### **How to Approach the Surgery**

1. **Keep the conversation exploratory**: Emphasize that you’re raising these issues because you care about equitable access to healthcare and want to understand the challenges the practice faces. This frames your inquiry as collaborative rather than confrontational.

2. **Stick to patient impact**: Focus on how the system affects patients, not just you personally. Frame the issues as potential barriers for vulnerable groups (elderly, disabled, digitally excluded) and ask what steps they can take to mitigate those impacts.

3. **Be solution-oriented**: When raising concerns, suggest changes (like better communication or flexible policies for missed calls) rather than just pointing out flaws. This positions you as someone offering help, not just criticizing.

---

### **Expanding the Inquiry**

Once you’ve had the conversation at New Bank Health Centre, you can consider investigating other local surgeries. Here's how to do so without being overbearing:

1. **Start with publicly available information**:
   - Look at reviews on NHS Choices or Google for nearby surgeries. This can give you a sense of whether similar complaints exist elsewhere.
   - Search Healthwatch Manchester reports for trends in patient complaints or issues related to digital triage systems.

2. **Talk to other patients**:
   - Discreetly ask friends, neighbors, or community groups about their experiences with GP surgeries. Frame it as casual research rather than investigative.

3. **Document your findings**:
   - Keep a log of the issues raised, specific examples, and the responses from surgeries or management. This can help you identify patterns and ensure your observations are thorough and accurate.

---

### **Elevating the Issue to a Wider Audience**

If you find that this is a broader issue affecting multiple practices, consider escalating it thoughtfully:

1. **Contact local journalism outlets**:
   - Both *The Mill* and *Manchester Post* are excellent choices for highlighting local stories with impact. Reach out to them with a short pitch explaining the problem, why it matters, and any data or anecdotes you’ve gathered.
   - You could offer to write a first-person piece about your experience, framing it as an example of a systemic issue.

2. **Approach advocacy groups**:
   - Healthwatch Manchester may be interested in a broader conversation about digital triage and patient access across the city.
   - National organizations like the Patients Association could also be allies in pushing for better standards.

3. **Frame your message positively**:
   - Avoid naming and shaming unless absolutely necessary. Instead, focus on how systemic improvements could make care more accessible and efficient for everyone.

---

### **Suggested Phrasing for Outreach**

Here’s a way to frame your inquiry or outreach, whether to the surgery, a journalist, or an advocacy group:

> I’ve noticed some challenges with the appointment system at my GP surgery that seem to disproportionately affect certain patient groups, like those who struggle with technology or have unpredictable schedules. While the system might be designed to manage demand, it seems to create barriers for many patients and could unintentionally inflate "missed appointment" statistics.
>
> I’ve started to gather insights into whether this is a local issue or part of a broader trend in Manchester. My goal isn’t to place blame but to highlight how systems might be improved to better serve patients. If this resonates with your audience or organization, I’d be happy to share what I’ve found and collaborate on next steps.

---

### **Staying Respectful and Balanced**

- Acknowledge the pressures GP surgeries face, such as staffing shortages and high demand.
- Focus on transparency and fairness in your inquiries and recommendations.
- Make clear that your ultimate goal is systemic improvement, not to target any individual or organization.

This approach should help you avoid being dismissed while ensuring your concerns are taken seriously, both locally and potentially on a wider scale.


#### You:
are there any express NHS policies about the specific issues raised here? I.e. can we encourage the practice to not delete messages, or to shedule, or at least inform/time-range, initial calls

#### ChatGPT:
Your concerns about the appointment system at New Bank Health Centre are valid, and aligning your suggestions with NHS guidelines can strengthen your case for improvements. Here are key NHS policies and recommendations relevant to your concerns:

### 1. **Patient Communication and Appointment Scheduling**

- **Good Communication Practices**: NHS England emphasizes that effective patient communication should begin at the first point of contact. This includes providing clear information about upcoming appointments, managing delays or cancellations, and ensuring patients can easily access information about their care. citeturn0search0

- **Appointment Management**: The NHS encourages practices to offer appointments that are appropriate and reasonable, considering the patient's circumstances. This includes providing options for face-to-face, telephone, or video consultations, and ensuring patients are informed about how and when they will receive further information regarding their care. citeturn0search2

**Recommendation**: Encourage the practice to implement scheduled callback times or provide time windows for telephone consultations. This approach respects patients' time and aligns with NHS guidelines on reasonable appointment scheduling.

### 2. **Handling Missed Appointments**

- **Reducing 'Did Not Attends' (DNAs)**: NHS England has issued guidance on reducing missed appointments, emphasizing the importance of clear communication and flexible systems to accommodate patients' needs. The goal is to improve patient experience and free up capacity for others. citeturn0search1

**Recommendation**: Advocate for a more flexible approach to missed calls, such as allowing patients to reschedule missed appointments within the same day or providing alternative methods for patients to communicate their availability. This strategy can help reduce DNAs and improve overall patient satisfaction.

### 3. **Digital Accessibility and Inclusivity**

- **Remote Consulting**: While the NHS Long Term Plan includes commitments to offer online and video consultations, it acknowledges that remote consulting can be a barrier for some patients. Therefore, it's essential to provide alternative access methods to ensure inclusivity. citeturn0search10
