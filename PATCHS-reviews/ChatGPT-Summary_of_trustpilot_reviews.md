# Summary of trustpilot reviews

#### You:
okay, I've pulled all trustpilot 1 star reviews of PATCHS in the last year (or almost), attached. 

Summarise the issues please.

Here’s a tight summary of the recurring problems in the 1-star Trustpilot reviews you attached:

- **Access is gated by short “windows” and capacity caps** (not 24/7). People are told to “try again” at 8am/2pm; slots vanish within minutes; sometimes PATCHS/practice is “unavailable” even during stated open times, and you can’t queue or submit to be picked up later. fileciteturn1file12turn1file17turn1file6
- **Triage/routing frequently feels wrong or unsafe.** Reports of the bot telling patients to go to A\&E or a dentist based on wording; external triage teams seen as lacking history/context; some say missed calls close the request and force a restart. fileciteturn1file1turn1file6turn1file11
- **Forms & UX are long, circular, and brittle.** Many steps; page jumps/reloads; repeated CAPTCHAs; “optional” fields required with minimum characters; hard to use on mobile. fileciteturn1file0turn1file3turn1file19
- **Attachments & login are flaky.** File uploads fail (“undefined files…”), password resets don’t arrive, and some get stuck in identity loops; NHS login sometimes isn’t enough, with requests for extra in-person ID/keys. fileciteturn1file8turn1file12turn1file15
- **Messaging is unreliable/one-way.** Requests or messages “disappear”; responses can auto-close with no way to reply or confirm resolution; help channels bounce patients between PATCHS and the practice. fileciteturn1file7turn1file2turn1file11
- **Digital exclusion & account friction.** Assumes smartphone/email; carers/partners run into unique-email rules; children on both parents’ accounts can block submissions; older or less tech-confident patients struggle. fileciteturn1file2turn1file17turn1file17
- **Practice integration gaps.** Even when PATCHS “works,” some practices don’t respond or mark themselves unavailable, leaving patients to start over by phone; doctors call back unpredictably and (per some reports) only once. fileciteturn1file0turn1file6turn1file1
- **Not just inconvenient—perceived clinical risk.** Delays/misroutes while unwell; one reviewer links delay to a hospital admission after falls; several call it “dangerous.” fileciteturn1file17turn1file5
- **Unwanted comms & opt-out problems.** Repeated texts/emails; difficulty unsubscribing; some felt coerced into joining from a “no-reply” email. fileciteturn1file1turn1file13
- **Trust & privacy concerns.** Worries about data handling/“data farming,” corporate ownership/location, and the .ai domain; some distrust the volume/tone of positive reviews. *(These are perceptions raised by reviewers.)* fileciteturn1file11turn1file7turn1file0turn1file6
- **Comparisons to previous tools.** Repeat prescriptions said to be easier on the NHS App; PATCHS adds steps without clear benefit. fileciteturn1file3

If you want, I can turn this into a one-pager for the PPG with “issue → user impact → example evidence” so you can drop it straight into your meeting pack.

#### ChatGPT:
Here are the main themes from the 2–3⭐ Trustpilot reviews you attached:

- **Good idea, inconsistent in practice.** Many say PATCHS is a solid concept (asynchronous messaging, questionnaires, written trail), but local surgeries “use it differently,” instantly close tickets, or can’t be reached through it—so outcomes vary wildly by practice. fileciteturn2file0

- **Access windows & caps still block care.** Reviewers repeatedly hit brief morning windows (e.g., 8:00–8:20) or “limit reached” messages; several ask why submissions aren’t 24/7 with later triage—especially for people at work. fileciteturn2file0

- **Slow/unclear follow-up and premature closure.** Requests can sit for hours without reply, or be marked “complete” when passed internally; some are told to phone anyway, undermining the digital route. fileciteturn2file0

- **Registration & integration glitches.** Accounts sometimes show “not registered with your GP,” or the system is “not available” for a given practice; overall, reviewers stress PATCHS is only as good as the surgery’s processes. fileciteturn2file0

- **Triage & relevance issues.** A few felt their concern was misinterpreted (e.g., routed to anxiety because they mentioned worry) or forced into generic question sets that don’t fit their case. fileciteturn2file0

- **Usability pains.** Sessions time out (\~30 min) and lose typed content; text boxes “eat” typing; app can’t start new requests for some; Safari/Chrome compatibility complaints; anxiety about “finishing on time.” fileciteturn2file0

- **Feature gaps vs expectations.** People want test results with trends, upcoming appointments, real two-way messaging, prescription lists, multi-issue submissions, and easier sharing of history—comparing PATCHS unfavourably to integrated portals like Epic MyChart. fileciteturn2file0

- **Digital exclusion & access controls.** Mandatory SMS codes disadvantage those without mobiles; geo-blocking blocks overseas carers for UK patients; older or less tech-confident patients struggle. Language support (e.g., Tigrinya) is requested. fileciteturn2file0

- **What works (when it works).** For simple/admin queries and repeats, messaging can be handy; some report prompt email replies and appreciate choosing preferred contact times; overall journey is “simple” when systems/staff are aligned. fileciteturn2file0

- **Frequent suggestions.** Open submissions 24/7 (triage later), remove/relax caps, allow multiple issues per request, extend/save sessions, improve browser/app support, enable proxies/carers (incl. abroad), add languages, and integrate results/appointments/prescriptions in one place. fileciteturn2file0

Want me to fold this with the 1⭐ summary into a one-page “Issues → Patient impact → Example quotes” handout for your PPG pack?


#### You:
focus on triage/routing/access complaints. Only from the 2 trustpilot files I gave on this chat, not from the project files. I want to know, with short quotes along with the name of the reviewer, exactly how this issue is failing patients who need access but can't get it, especially where they identify this system as the culprit.

#### You:
I also had grok do a breakdown of these reviews, and it mostly agrees with you. Look at the issues in our project files, and identify which issues (if any) will likely be improved by this move to PATCHS, and which will not.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. I cross-checked your project issues against what PATCHS actually does in the 1–3★ Trustpilot sets and Grok’s write-up. Here’s the blunt mapping.

# Will likely improve (only if NBHC configures PATCHS accordingly)

- **“Black-hole” requests / no way to reply** → *Can* improve if PATCHS tickets are kept open for back-and-forth messaging instead of being closed on first contact attempt, as Grok notes is a practice choice (not a system limitation). fileciteturn5file19turn5file12turn6file8
- **Unpredictable callbacks** → *Can* improve if the practice uses PATCHS’s request fields to capture preferred contact windows and commits to multiple, scheduled call attempts (again, process/config more than platform). fileciteturn5file5turn5file16turn6file1

# Depends entirely on practice policy/config (PATCHS doesn’t fix it by itself)

- **“Missed call → delete request → start again tomorrow.”** PATCHS won’t stop this unless NBHC changes the rule to keep tickets open and reschedule; reviews show restarts after one missed call are still common. fileciteturn5file19turn5file12turn5file14turn6file8
- **Confusion about “same-day” vs “within 1 working day.”** PATCHS can present clearer wording, but the SLA is set by the surgery; reviewers still report long silences and premature closures. fileciteturn5file5turn6file8
- **Practice not responding / closing requests early.** PATCHS enables responses, but “no reply” and instant closures remain a practice-behaviour problem in the reviews. fileciteturn6file8

# Unlikely to improve (and may worsen) without major changes

- **Digital-only gatekeeping & exclusion (no robust phone/in-person path).** Your complaint centres on digital-only access; PATCHS often adds more digital friction (mandatory SMS/email, proxy limits, geo-blocks). Expect *no improvement* without equal non-digital routes. fileciteturn5file12turn5file10turn5file17turn5file18
- **Short “submission windows” & capacity caps.** Reviews repeatedly hit 8:00–8:20 openings, lunch closures, and “limit reached.” PATCHS supports 24/7 *technically*, but in practice it’s often closed most of the day—so this will **not** improve unless NBHC removes caps and opens 24/7 for queuing. fileciteturn5file9turn5file13turn5file17
- **Form/UX pain (no save/resume, timeouts, circular flows, uploads failing).** Your project notes call for better form design; PATCHS reviews cite timeouts, lost text, loops, and brittle fields—this is **unlikely to be better** out of the box. fileciteturn5file12turn5file16turn6file9turn5file6
- **No scheduled appointment booking from the form.** Your requirement is “offer/confirm a time, then patient accepts.” PATCHS often still routes to unscheduled callbacks or assigns times you must phone to change—so this stays **unfixed** unless NBHC offers proper slot-booking. fileciteturn5file5turn5file9
- **Requiring both phone *and* email.** Your issue flags exclusion if only one contact method is available; PATCHS commonly demands both, so **no improvement** here. fileciteturn5file16

---

## Bottom line for your PPG talking points

- PATCHS **can** help with messaging and scheduling **only if** NBHC changes policies (keep tickets open, schedule/attempt calls properly). Otherwise the patient experience will feel the same. fileciteturn6file8
- The biggest blockers you raised—**digital-only access, capacity caps, deletion after missed calls, unscheduled call-backs, and brittle forms**—**will not improve** just by moving platform; reviews show these persist under PATCHS when practices configure it that way. fileciteturn5file19turn5file12turn5file17turn5file13
