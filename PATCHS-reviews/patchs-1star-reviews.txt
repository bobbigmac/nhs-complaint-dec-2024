It is like a virus.
I don't have an iphone but I keep getting multiple messages about the same appointments on a small mobile. I have told my GP surgery several times that I don't want it as I find all the messages annoying, confusing and don't have enough memory space on my mobile for them. I have even unsubscribed after following an address they sent me but I still keep get pinged. It is like a virus. Once they have you they don't let go. I am able to write my appointments down in my diary thank you. The pings are just making me angry as well as confused and I am more likely to miss an appointment. Please respect my wishes, not yours. You are supposed to serve and help. I feel like throwing my phone away.

Total waste of time
I have been trying to get an appointment 😩 with this long drawn out I started Monday 1st today is Wednesday the 3rd and this site is telling me to go to A E
Which is ridiculous 🙄 I don't need A and E I just need an appointment with a GP I've spoken with the receptionists and the computa is telling her I need A and E so won't even look to give me an appointment what does it take for someone to die before they sit up and smell the coffee
I'm very disappointed with Patches

This technology was introduced for already overpaid lazy receptionist that think they know everything in the medical world to look at what’s suppose to confidential information and judge weather the doctors have time to deal with the problem there is no time scheduled for a call they just ring whenever they want and only once so if you are to miss the call your unable to ring back and have to file another thing on this rubbish system for me to miss the call and the circle continues all in all what a waste of everyone’s time and effort if your older then 40 good luck with this terrible terrible idea whoever sanctioned this to be used needs to be sacked

An absolute crap system. Takes me round and round, in circles...verify you're not a bot..successful...verify again and then again! Also, mostly 'the system is not functioning, please try again later'. Used to be easy enough, just to order repeat medication, on the nhs app. But, no, let's put in a few harder steps for anyone to do anything. Morons.

Patchs - I don't want to hear any more about it!
We have recently moved to a new area so got introduced to Patchs. What a nightmare! At a time when you a medical problem, this is the last thing you need. We are in our 70's and computer literate, but believe me, if you didn't have high blood pressure before you use Paths you certainly will after trying to negotiate it. Is this the governments idea of cutting down on staff and so making a cheaper nhs? Has this been thought up by students who have been using technology since they were two years old. How lovely it used to be to ring your gp, speak to a recepionist and get an appointment. I do realise that those days have gone, but really, Patchs adds such a lot of stress which we could well do without.

Horrific app
Horrific app.
I consistently told I had swollen glands on body, yet the app kept asserting that I had a ‘sore throat’ and then a ‘skin condition.’ I had to answer about 25 questions to get to that point, where it was telling me to go to a pharmacy.
Also, very few people in the surgery can use it as many people are without a smartphone or email address or confident with that much reading and typing.
We’re not in Silicon Valley, we’re in Tottenham.
Fund NHS not GP apps.

Harder than needed to make a very simple request
Had a very simple request with regard to a pre existing condition. Had to go through several steps asking questions which i have answered many times before. Strange to have fields which are designated as "optional" then requiring a response before can proceed. Annoying when a presumably common response is "no" to have it rejected because field requires minimum of 5 characters.

A nightmare of an app that cannot be escaped from.
A nightmare of an app, badly designed, circular in places, and exhausting for an ill person to have to go through just to get an appointment. Patients want to talk to people, not machine learning. What is even worse, is even though I never opted into PATCHS, but it is impossible to opt out. I have tried every possible way to do so with my local surgery, Lancaster Medical Practice. Numerous phonecalls, letters, visits in person, emails with the Practice Manager. Each time I'm assured that I will not be contacted by PATCHS again, and each time I am. A total farce. It is suppose to be AI, but it is as dumb as a rock. Also, last year it's reviews on here were 1.5 star, now it is 4.5. It seems one thing it can do is remove negative reviews, even if it can't remove me from its system. Some practices have done away with it, I wish mine would.

One of the worse experiences I’ve ever had with the NHS. Needed to book an in person appointment with GP. Surgery wouldn’t and said I had to use patches app. Ended up in an awful circular ridiculous bot chat that a) didn’t address or even identify my issue correctly and b) didn’t allow me to book an appointment.

Subsequently the GP practice had to call the next day. So it was a total waste of mine and their time.

Really don’t understand how Patches has such high ratings. I really worry for non-app literate patients and am confident it’s limiting access to services for people who give up rather than deal with the unhelpful and incorrect questions.

I feel sorry for elderly and others. I've spoken to many of my friends. There just going to the walk in centers. Which I might start doing. Easier then answering pathetic questions. Kicks my anxiety into gear.
Hopefully patchs will be stopped soon. Before many people start dying.

I am a 76 year old with Parkinson's
I am a 76 year old with Parkinson's. I have been on medication for some years now but felt the problem was getting worse so I wanted to see the doctor about increasing my medication.
Tried to make an appointment on the phone and got a recorded message to use Patches on the internet. I spent 2 hours reading the instructions on how to do it, at my age the internet is not something I understand although I do have a computer. In frustration I went to my surgery and spoke with the receptionist who was very dismissive and just told me to use the internet. I kept making phone calls and eventually got to speak to a human. She asked for my details and said the doctor would call me back, this never happened. Next day I called again and was told a doctor would call back before 6.30 pm again nothing next day the phone was answered by a human who made me an appointment for the next day, its tomorrow so lets see what happens.
This is a ridiculous system totally unusable and not fit for purpose.
This was at Poplar House Surgery, Durham Avenue, St. Annes St Annes. Lancashire

abysmal
I'm not sure how anyone else in their right mind has given this good reviews.

if you have a simple query, you have to wade through a dozen irrelevant questions.

it would not accept my attachements.
tried a jpg => "undefined files are not supported, please try another format"
so converted to pdf => "There was a problem uploading the following attachment: driving license.pdf"

UI is horrible, clunky and buggy.

to book an appointment, apparently I need a key. for which they want me to bring various ID to the surgery. very much defeating the purpose of online booking.
so that fact that I'm already logged in with my NHS id is not enough??

simple email would be 100x better.

The worst invention ever!
How many old, vulnerable, and uneducated people are going to die because they do not have access to use patches or if they do, use it? Most of these good reviews must be lying or just thinking of themselves. You can't even send a message out of hours. We cannot make an appointment via the phone, so to the people stating you can, that is not true.
It asks for far too many questions that are not necessitated. How many human energy hours are going to be spent on this? Millions and billions. I don't always have 30 minutes to play around with a laptop just to get a prescription, or urgent meds. The ai doesn't even understand everything you write.

Too many questions, to get an appointment
I have chronic conditions, need regular prescriptions. The details are all in my medical records. Patchs asks questions and knows nothing. Trying to get an appointment took me 30 mins to answer the questions and take photos. Photos wouldn't load into Patchs. Then I had to say I wanted an appointment. I tell Patchs I can't be contacted by mobile phone at work, and guess what, the surgery staff try to contact me by mobile phone. How is this a better service for the end user patient.

I gave the details and two hours later my wife was contacted by text message saying they needed more info (I had asked they contacted me as fortunately I had the time to do this today). My wife jumped out of a meeting to respond immediately. It's now are 9pm and we've had no contact. Patchs has made it harder to access a GP, not easier.

Why do you never answer the help bit about logging in to it, i have e mailed 3-4 times since Sunday but no answer back and i have informed my Gp and they have acknowledge that i cannot log in you just go round in a infinity loop, Name, DOB, Postcode, Do you want to access the account or Log in to the account both do not do anything, then back into the loop Name, DOB, Postcode...

I do not think patches is fit for propose to be used by the Gp's and the NHS, if i cannot log in to it and get no help whats so ever, So how do you expect somebody who's say 75 gonna be able to use it,

it's a joke how did you get the contract from the NHS as there are 5 or 6 other website just like it out there, Patches must have been the cheapest one,
I have done a deep dive into patches on the internet and found a few things out,

But yet my Gp still send messages on there knowing full well i cannot log in for some strange reason only known to Patches, It's just a money making ploy, This so called IA technology it do's not make it easer or faster i myself think it slows it down and cloggs the Gp System up,

They must be making Thousands charging the Surgery's up and down the uk to use and access the system

This is my second review of the AI system and you still get no help from them

Not fit for purpose - continually going offline or not working at our surgery. Admin don’t triage your request properly. It’s no substitute for the old fashioned receptionists from 20-30 years ago where you could walk into a surgery and make an appointment to see a doctor. Probably ok for GP’s that aren’t patients so don’t have to use it. It just a barrier between patients and proper healthcare. Where is The Duty of Care - not with the Patchs system

Impossible to use , you just go round in circles
Today is an appropriate date for this review because PATCHS IS A JOKE! Absolutely useless. I just want to book an appointment and my surgery demands we must use this patchs for it because they no longer book by phone. IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. There is no actual option to book an appointment , asking for help with a problem is impossible ( nobody replies) and if you are unwell you don't want to be faffing about messaging someone who doesn't even respond. It's very inconvenient . I'm going to have to change surgery to one who doesn't force this rubbish on people, no regard for people who don't have internet access or can't use it , everyone doesn't have someone to help them and frankly, even a technology expert would struggle with it. . God help people who have learning difficulties and old people trying to use this rubbish, it seems as though they're deliberately making it difficult so they can ' push people off'.

Grateful but frustrated and disappointed
I'm grateful to be able to contact my GP online at all, but the PATCHs system is extremely poorly designed.

Standard design practices are either absent or implemented very badly. For example, after every message I submit, the page reloads and view moves to the top. I have to scroll down to find my place. Then, 1 second later PATCHS sends a reply, which makes the page move again. Probably the 1 second delay is simulated to make it seem like a human interaction. This is a poor joke, as nothing about the frontend implementation is anything like existing chat software.

Overall it feels unprofessional, like a student project made by people who lack experience in real world software applications. Why this experiment would be forced on vulnerable users I have no idea.

Can't recall dates. Since first using patches for this episode, subsequent request via patcheschaf been largely ineffective. A vulnerable patientvl in need of essential meds had to ring surgery,(issues with long virtual queue) and dispensing tesco pharmacy who was extremely helpful. Reception staff need more customer training, tick box responses stresses me more. Got to listen to patient! Needless to say I have been patient and professional in my interaction even when one respondercrefused to identify herself
On a positive not the first GP intervention was helpful but he failed to review as expresses. 2nd and 3rd Gp intervention excellent listen to my symptoms and offered save help albeit symptoms persist but they tried their best. This is the the first time I have done to show professionals my journey and experiences to my recovery. I appreciate nhs is stretched however a little care and compassion is not costly but employ people whoose work ethics are humane and train them to listen, speak clearly(I'm a 73 doddery but intelligent individual) and treat a potential with respect and dignity. I hopeci won't be subjected to discrimination or penalised for raising these honest experiences. I am happy to be interviewed. I hope the telephone interactions are recorded for training and safety.

Patch’s itself is really good, shame about the GP surgery staff
Patch’s itself is really good but the people reading the messages unfortunately do not read them correctly and like to close off requests before anything has been actioned. This has happened every time and because the request is closed there’s no option to respond, meaning a second request has to be made.
That is more about the staff at the GP surgery than the systems however, and if they took proper notice of the request then the system would be ideal

Confidence Lost in Patchs due to Unanswered Messages That Have Disappeared
On 21 Oct 24, I hastened my GP for test results. That message has not been answered. It has disappeared from my messages box.
On 9 Oct 24, I agreed to go on a 2 hours' course at my nearest hospital about my newly diagnosed condition. I was required to have an appointment at that hospital for a test related to that condition. I expected my GP Surgery to ring me to agree dates and times. My hastener, on 25 Oct 24, is also unanswered and has also disappeared.
Today, 7 Nov 24, I have hastened the 25 Oct 24 message and I am about to hasten the 21 Oct 24 one. I am not confident that today's 2 hasteners will fare any better.

Abysmal, Atrocious And Not Fit For Purpose, ?
I don't know were all these good reviews of patches have come from (probably got paid to write them for the company)
Has I find it to be abysmal, atrocious and not fit for purpose, When trying to contact my Gp's practice Henry Moore in Castleford, Uk, They just ignore it for say 2 weeks then send a e mail saying it has been closed, Why as it been closed nobody as contacted me about it, No phone call or face to face with a Gp so why close the request,

As anybody looked in to these global companies, its a company that owns a company that owns a company, and why 3 name changes over a 4 years period,
Patchs Health is the trading name of Spectra Analytics Limited, who is owned by TELUS HEALTH (UK) LTD who is owned by Telus In Ontario,Canada,
Just Look in to there board members there a Sir, an Ex BBC Director, Say no more about the BCC.. Jimmy Savile ...ect

Who in English government and the crumbling NHS gave the contract to them,
I take it they was the highest bidder OR CHEAPEST .....

Ridiculous and not fit for purpose
This is such a poor way to make appointments. It is not convienient at all as you cant use it out of working hours. I understand if you are trying to get an emergency appointment but if you need an appointment that is not an emergency you should be able to use the site to book out of surgery hours. Not everyone has a job where they can have their phone on during the day to fill out an endless form which is pointless. I work in a school and can't just do what I like when I like. The site also closes at lunch time! It also does not give you the option of appointment times instead you have to wait for that text telling you to come in at a certain date/time and then you have to call anyway to try to change the time to fit around your work or as close to. GP direct had a much better system before with patient access, I don't know why they changed it.

Patchs is not a patch on making a telephone call.
If you do not get onto the system at 8:00 a.m. you are likely to be told it is full for the day and to come back tomorrow! If a Friday then call back on Monday! You cannot even leave a message! Not everyone is up and able to go online at 8:00 a.m. precisely. Insomniacs might finally be asleep, some people will be on their way to work possibly driving, others will be at work and others sleeping or returning from a night shift. Is the assumption that if you need to see a doctor you are not going to work?! Parents might be taking children to school or at least preparing them for the day. Not everyone can use a computer. There appears to be no flexibility. On one occasion I rang 111 after not getting through on Patchs and they made me an appointment with the doctor for about 9:30a.m. the same day! So the appointments exist but access to them is made very difficult. If ill you neither want to nor are able to jump through hoops to see a doctor. The system might suit the doctors but it does not work for a number of their patients.

Disgraceful experience
Absolutely appalling ! You get 2 minutes at the start of the day to log a request or appointment, after that a message comes up saying " it is unavailable due to reaching their safe capacity limit" . What does that even mean ? If its an online system why do they have to have a limit ? You should just be able to go in and leave a message or book an appointment like any normal efficient system . This is simply not fit for purpose. I was then waiting to get through on the phone for over 3 hours then gave up !! I am afraid doctors' surgeries do not exist anymore, there is no point in registering with them.

Group Practice is currently unavailable for health problems on PATCHS. They will next be available tomorrow at 07:30.

We have now reached full capacity for online submissions and PATCHS is now closed. We will reopen tomorrow at 7:30am.

District Nurse response and attitude
Glenroyd Medical Centre reception staff and Dr Khalid's performances, courtesy, attitude, advice, fast response time and overall service was simply outstanding.
I was under the impression that a nurse would see me within a couple of days, regarding an assessment and issuing of medical creams and dressings.
After 5 days I heard nothing from any nurses, so I went into patches and also found no referral had been made. I then made a separate referral and told the practice I would be visiting in about an hour to check if any dressings or creams had been put to one side to pick up.
There was nothing and whilst at the reception a female District Nurse (DN) rang. Overall, I found her attitude, manners, overbearing interruptions and seemingly "couldn't care less attitude" very disconsoling, which left me astonished, especially compared to the extremely helpful reception staff and Dr Khalid. My basic options were to agree to an appointment (home visit) in 3 weeks, go to a "Walk-In Centre", or cancel. I booked the appointment
I also highly extoll the virtues and amazing helpfulness from the Duty Pharmacist, Mona, at Cohen's Pharmacy, where I bought dressings and creams.
I sincerely hope that the rest of the DNs in the practice are better. The DSs in my previous practice (Over Wyre) were superb. Maybe I caught this one on a bad day.

Patches does not allow you to enter a preferred number to be called on
GP practices will only call one number. Unfortunately the preferred contact number on patches is defaulted to the mobile number. My practice try and call me on my mobile but I live in an area of poor mobile reception and calls don't get through and my call is closed. It is mandatory to enter a mobile number on Patches, so you won't get heallthcare if you don't own a mobile - discriminatory. I am being deprived care because of this useless system - should be withdrawn from the market until this is sorted out as you shouldn't be deprived healthcare because you live in an area of poor mobile reception or don't own a mobile. Healthcare should be easily accessible by all.

Very poor software
This software is very poor, either as written or as configured for my GP practice. In this day and age not providing 24 x 7 access to this software is frustrating - people need access day and night. As other reviewers have mentioned, having to connect to the software at 08:00 and, if later in the morning often being told that all the ‘slots’ have been taken and to try again at 14:00 or tomorrow is infuriating. My GP resists being contacted by phone or email and attempts to drive patients to Patchs. The software design appears to assume that all requests are of similar ‘weight’. Today I wanted to book a low priority telephone appointment in, say, two weeks time. Patchs, or the configuration doesn’t allow that. In addition, presumably to support the AI approach, there are only tick boxes and no fields where the patient can type in important info about what is wrong.

As an ex Management Consultant and Software QA Engineer I cannot believe that this program is the best we can do. My advice to my GP practice is to find a competitor which offers more functionality.

Are we deliberately making healthcare inaccessible? / GDPR issues
User Experience is my day job and I have to say we're severely missing the mark on providing accessible healthcare if we are limited to the options like PATCHS to simply book an appointment.

When I called the surgery I could only get an appointment in 2.5 weeks time. By this time my health may have deteriorated or complicated further or I might be wasting everyone's time if I've recovered.

My second option, I'm advised, is to use is the online PATCHS system to be 'seen quicker'. Clearly a negative motivator, given the alternative timelines, to use PATCHS.

Using PATCHS I counted 16 steps and 10 minutes before I could submit a 'request'. It was unclear to me if, as I was advised, this was how to book an appointment or if a 'request' was part of the process of booking an appointment. After calling the surgery again, I was told I needed to wait after submitting a request for someone to call me at some point within the next 48 hours. I received contact from someone on the PATCHS chat later requesting verification of my address which, if I provided this, PATCHS told me it would be uploaded to my medical record(!?)... Why would my GP need to see my council tax bill on my medical record 😂. This is not only a privacy issue but a breach of GDPR regulation. Naturally, I asked so submit this another way, but looks like for now we're constrained by a system that can't intelligently predict every conversation a Medical Centre might have. Irony!

Update: PATCHS, despite being an online service provider, closes shop at the weekend and prevents any requests from being sent. I understand staffing operating hours but that shouldn't stop me submitted a request like other help desk services.

Bottom line: As an end-user, the whole system feels like it has been designed to reduce contact with the GP which defeats the principle of accessible healthcare. I may be wrong, but there is so much scope for improvement here, but as far as I can see, there's no change since I had to start using it and likely no motivation to change as they probably have a comfortable monopoly with the NHS.

And to be fair, the GPs working in my healthcare centre are brilliant, and I've always received great care, support, and advice. I just wanted to share my patient journey here as I can't believe the digital barriers I'm witnessing to be seen, heard, and cared for. I hope someone can address these issues or propose a better service provider in the near future.

These novel DIY assessments are not what the NHS was originally built for. It's a major fail. Walkin and hospitals are rammed as a result.

Couldn't get to the Landing Page after logging on
Well at my GP practice this system is absolutely useless. Rang first to make an appointment waiting in the queue, finally got through then I had to tell a complete stranger about my personal health issues Then I was told my GP had requested a Face to Face appointment and I had to follow a link to make the appointment. Followed the link and had to register with Patchs and all I got was an information page. No option at all to make an appointment. It was not the Landing Page as described in the information sheet. Tried again and I was just going around in circles!! I then rang up to explain this only to be told there were no appointments left and to ring the following morning at 8!!! Tried to ring at 8 and kept getting cut off. Tried the link again that was available for 10 days and got a message to say 'merged patients cannot log into Patchs". What?

This service is just rubbish (unless it’s it’s just my GP service which is definitely rubbish). Sign up to Patches, verify your email, login, make a request for yourself, and…… nope, it doesn’t let you make a request, just sends you back to the start. After ten times of trying here I am back in the usual 40 minutes (if you’re lucky) telephone queue, because PATCHES DOESN’T WORK.
Now adding more - thought I’d try again and guess what, it now doesn’t even recognise my password or email address as a valid account. Welcome to the NHS people.

Out of the blue
Out of the blue, received a 'no-reply' email from 'Patchs' purporting to be conveying a message from my GP surgery, suspicious, so did a little digging, strong smell of 'big data farming' here. GP surgery had no right to pass my contact details to this company, without my consent. The email wanted me to click on a link in order to read the message, but seems that if I did so I would automatically be opted in to their system, and be giving on-going access to my confidential medical records. I ignored it, but then they pestered with a reminder, so I blocked the sender, any future messages will be treated as spam. Another NHS waste of OUR money. Why can't GPs just get off their backsides and do the job they are being (handsomely) paid to do, without all these silly barriers and diversions?

I'm not sure it is PATCHS that's at fault as when I can get to fill a form in it works OK but my surgery keep closing it off telling you to try at a specified time but when you do you get the same thing and can never get anywhere. I tried on a Friday mid morning as was quite unwell and had been for a while. It told me to try at 13.00. I did that and was told they weren't taking any more requests and to try 7.00 on Monday. I did that. Logged in and started filling in the form but got cut off and message came up saying they weren't taking any more and to try 9.00.

One can only submit requests during GP…
One can only submit requests during GP opening hours which is impractical for non urgent requests. Requests get triaged by an external team that does not know the patient history. What they deem non urgent and standard results in an average 3 week waiting time for an appointment with no context of patient history. Surgery reception seems unable to do anything about it if one is unhappy with the triage result. Frustratingly robotic questions. I have no idea who is reading anything I am typing, whether they are working from home and how my data is being handled, especially when photos attached. What happened to just calling your GP for an appointment and seeing a doctor. An unnecessary additional step one is forced to take which only benefits the GP's who think they are triaging their patients better and employing less receptionists. Also concerned that the resulting number of phone consultations resulting from Patchs will miss off other unrelated medical issues which would be picked up in person. I have no idea who has written the 5 star reviews as all I can see is one one-star review after another.

Waste of time and NHS money
I still cant see a user menu, all I get is the appointments page. I used to be able to see my test results for two years now I can't see any. . The help button just tells you how great they are. Finally found an email address to report the problem. The terse response, 'tell your GP practice,. in spite of the very many messages on Patchs website sayoing'dont contact your practice for Patchs issues' . Their triaging is also complete nonsense viz, 'what are you doing about it ?' 'what caused this ?' Very amateur interface. Let me suggest a better one.

Assumes that I have a Smart phone
This system assumes that I have a Smart phone ,I have a mobile phone so I get a text message that cannot be deciphered other than it is from the patchs.ai . What is the point? Total waste of time for me ,so no I do not use this system.

Another process wasting NHS money
Another process and additional waste of money to the NHS. What is the point in having this if a person then has to review it, it is not cutting out time its taking up more time adding this extra process in. And by providing a service that can only be accessed on a device is alienating the elderly.

My GP surgery has started to use this process so even if you get through on the phone they fill a patches out which is adding another process by it then sitting in the balance of the decision for a gp whom is going off of a few select words that the call handler has chosen to write down.

When I have filled the patches form in myself and i am notified a response would be made within 48hours. I call after this time and noone can see my request and apparently patches had "gone down" that day. What an absolute waste of money...!!!

There is also no way of replying to a response. So if a response is made to your patches request the request is closed without even asking if that resolved the request or allowing the person to send a response. Not user friendly at all..!!!

Not fit for purpose
Not fit for purpose. I tried calling my GP multiple times, but kept being told the phone queue was full. So I decided to register with Patchs because I was told I could contact my GP through them. This turned out to not be true. I can't contact my GP through patchs. I have tried repeatedly to log into Patchs, but they say my password was wrong. I have only just set up my account and I know exactly what password I used. The email I received telling me I now had an account with them asked me to leave feedback, but I couldn't log in, so I couldn't tell them how useless their service is.

Yet another barrier between patients and doctors. Why surgeries use this? To get the same amount of money from NHS while working less.

Not suitable for humans
This Patches system is inadequate. The 8 o’clock telephone rush, has now been replaced by the 8am and 2pm Patches rush. Since the system ‘reaches capacity’ very quickly you are in exactly the same boat as when you rang up for an appointment! Not only has this system eliminated older people who have not kept up with technology, but it has made it just as difficult to get an appointment. The software seems to work pretty well but that is just not the point. One deficient system has been replaced by a more irritating deficient system, which further disadvantages the people most likely to become unwell. It would almost be a funny Orwellian joke if it wasn’t so tragic. These systems are not just things that are ‘happening’. They are the result of a deliberate decision by somebody. It’s rather like Horizon and look how well that turned out.

The system is rubbish
The system is rubbish. Nothing wrong with what we used before. More difficult to get an appointment now since Patchs than before. False information saying you can make an appointment when you never can. The times they make it available is not suited to people who work. Get rid of it.

Rubbish system
What a farcical system to try and get a doctors appointment via, 10 stupid questions, e.g. What do you think is causing your symptoms?......how the hell do I know that's why \I need to speak to a doctor.
This is just another way to steer people away from getting medical attention

My wife keeps trying to reorder vital…
My wife keeps trying to reorder vital repeat Alzheimer’s medication for her father. She is registered as carer and has PoA for both her Mum and Dad. Our primary care surgery is very poor, unhelpful and responsive. So my wife is totally reliant on Patchs. But despite trying all day to sign in to order the medication the site continues not to recognise her password previously accepted on numerous occasions and when trying to reset the password the Patchs system fails every time to mail her back with reset instructions.
NHS- if you are increasingly expecting stressed out people to kry things online can you please make sure your systems work and our responsive?

Still waiting for response
Posted on Patchs on the Tuesday, easy to set up and use, but by Thursday no response from Surgery. Called and receptionist said he had found my message and would pass it on???. Over 48 hours now and still waiting for a response for pain meds. So Patchs idea may be good, but not if your GP surgery is not responding to requests.

Trying to make a simple appointment
Trying to make a simple appointment. Fill in 10 lines of silly questions - and then get back, a day later, an inappropriate response from, I presume, from a receptionist !

Best we go back to waiting 1 hour on the phone every morning.

What a complete waste of our time and taxes.

Pathetic service not a service to serve…
Pathetic service not a service to serve but to defer providing service...
I was in the bathroom when the clinician from the surgery called and so I missed the call; she couldn't call back, I had to go through submitting a new request and wait 48 hours all over again ...it is pathetic 😒 not at all a service to serve its a way to avoid service, atrocious and impersonal for the elderly, a total farse!

Awful
Awful. When I finally worked out the relationship between my NHS login, Patchs and my GP surgery I managed to get in. Only to find Patchs unavailable, in other words turned off.

Waited 25 mins on the phone to the surgery, a line that was so bad she had to call me back. Patchs "turned off" because of high demand! What on earth is the point of having the system if you're going to turn it off?

Call back tomorrow at 8am with the rest of the population and get one of the very few appointments available in 2 weeks' time.

This government has destroyed our NHS.

Expect Nothing
I entered my message, answered the same questions from the practice. Than nothing, absolutely nothing. Over 3 weeks later, still nothing.
I’d have better luck if I entered the lottery for an appointment.
Foolishness
