# PATCHS Access Issues Analysis - Grok

Date: 17/09/2025, 00:49:25

## User

I'm trying to get my NHS doctor's practice to fix their access issues (they have a digital-only triage-first system that requires users to fill in a form that might require a doctor to call them at an unspecified time, and if they miss the call, their submission is deleted, requiring them to start over from scratch, tomorrow...)... They are moving to a new system called PATCHS (or patchs.ai) which is a slightly better digital-only system that slightly improves _some_ of the issues, mainly integrating better with the practice, but the experience for the patient looks to be basically the same.

I've collected the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews for PATCHS from trustpilot, can you analyse them in depth for access issues in particular, and break out the detail of reviews and issues raised, so I can bring these to the practice team to ensure they configure the new system to have the best chance for success and improvements, and any additional non-system-linked suggestions or issues from these irked patients that might also help with access issues.

### Overview of Analysis
I've reviewed all the 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star Trustpilot reviews provided for PATCHS (patchs.ai), focusing primarily on access issues. These reviews span from late 2023 to September 2025, with a total of approximately 80 reviews (around 40 1-star, 10 2-star, and 30 3-star). Access issues are the dominant theme, appearing in over 80% of the reviews, often intertwined with usability, responsiveness, and equity concerns. Many reviewers express frustration that PATCHS acts as a "barrier" to healthcare rather than an enabler, exacerbating existing NHS challenges like understaffing and limited appointments.

Key themes in access issues:
- **Timing and Availability:** Limited windows for submitting requests, leading to rapid "capacity" closures.
- **Usability and Technical Barriers:** Complex interfaces, glitches, and requirements that exclude non-tech-savvy users (e.g., elderly, those without smartphones/email).
- **Response and Follow-Up Problems:** Delayed or absent responses, missed calls, and forced restarts.
- **Equity and Discrimination:** Disadvantages for working people, elderly, non-English speakers, or those without digital access.
- **Integration with GP Practices:** Issues stemming from how practices configure/use PATCHS, such as triage mismanagement or overriding patient needs.
- **Non-System-Linked Suggestions:** Broader patient frustrations (e.g., phone alternatives, staffing) that could inform hybrid access models.

I've broken this down into categories below, with summaries, frequency (approximate % of reviews mentioning the issue), and specific examples/quotes from reviews. Where relevant, I've noted if the issue seems configurable in PATCHS (based on reviewer descriptions, e.g., practice-set limits) or if it's a core system flaw. At the end, I provide actionable recommendations for your practice to configure PATCHS effectively and address access holistically.

### Categorized Access Issues

#### 1. **Limited Availability Windows and Rapid Capacity Closures** (Mentioned in ~60% of reviews)
   This is the most common access complaint: PATCHS often "closes" shortly after opening (e.g., 8-8:20 AM), preventing submissions. Reviewers note it's only available during daytime/working hours, excluding workers, and non-urgent requests can't be queued for later. This leads to repeated attempts over days, increasing frustration and potentially worsening health issues.

   - **Frequency Breakdown:** 70% of 1-star, 50% of 2-star, 40% of 3-star.
   - **Examples:**
     - JC (2-star, 16 Dec 2024): "It opens at 8.00am and by 8.20am it is closed! ... took a number of attempts over a number of days."
     - Steve How (2-star, 30 Jan 2025): "The system could operate 24 seven ... almost inaccessible for those that work and do not have access during working hours."
     - Sue Strickland (1-star, 3 Sept 2025): "Trying to get an appointment ... started Monday 1st today is Wednesday the 3rd and this site is telling me to go to A E."
     - Roger Weetch (1-star, 24 Jul 2025): "For the fourth time consecutively the surgery has been unavailable ... Why cannot a message be submitted and saved until the surgery connects?"
     - Pink (1-star, 17 Apr 2024): "The system is only open for a few minutes each day - and then closes down. When you finally get through after a week ... no appointments."
   - **Configurable?** Likely yes—practices can set request limits and hours. Core system allows 24/7 submissions, but practices restrict to manage volume.

#### 2. **Usability and Technical Glitches** (Mentioned in ~50% of reviews)
   Reviewers describe PATCHS as "clunky," "circular," and non-intuitive, with issues like timeouts, failed uploads, password resets, and mandatory fields that reject short answers (e.g., "no" requires 5 characters). This creates barriers for quick access, especially for ill or stressed users.

   - **Frequency Breakdown:** 60% of 1-star, 40% of 2-star, 30% of 3-star.
   - **Examples:**
     - Dave w (3-star, 4 Jun 2025): "Times you out after thirty minutes ... lost all my entered information."
     - Denise Spencer (3-star, 21 Mar 2025): "The typing would keep disappearing ... I would have to re-write it all again ... end up giving up."
     - Mark Elliott (1-star, 15 Aug 2025): "Optional fields requiring a response ... 'no' rejected because minimum of 5 characters."
     - Steve (1-star, 26 Jun 2025): "Would not accept my attachments ... UI is horrible, clunky and buggy."
     - AcidCasualEightyEight (1-star, 9 May 2025): "Go round in a infinity loop ... Name, DOB, Postcode ... it's a joke."
     - AvB (1-star, 7 Jul 2025): "Unintuitive ... first page you have to click the title (not in a box) to proceed."
   - **Configurable?** Partially—practices can simplify forms, but core UI (e.g., timeouts, field rules) seems system-level. Integration with NHS login causes loops.

#### 3. **Delayed or Absent Responses and Follow-Up Issues** (Mentioned in ~45% of reviews)
   Submissions often lead to no response, closed requests without resolution, or missed calls (e.g., one attempt only, at unspecified times). If missed, users must restart, deleting progress. This discourages access, especially for ongoing issues.

   - **Frequency Breakdown:** 55% of 1-star, 30% of 2-star, 40% of 3-star.
   - **Examples:**
     - Muriel Cornwell (2-star, 29 Nov 2024): "Put in a request at 9.30am and still haven't had a reply at 12.30."
     - Janice Bennett (1-star, 22 Jul 2025): "Useless AI ... grabbed one term ... got told to go and visit a dentist. Request closed."
     - Phil Ch (1-star, 7 Jun 2025): "Tell Patchs I can't be contacted by mobile at work ... surgery staff try to contact me by mobile."
     - Parus mani (1-star, 16 Nov 2023): "Missed the call ... couldn't call back, had to submit a new request and wait 48 hours all over again."
     - Sharon Robinson (1-star, 15 Dec 2023): "Posted on Tuesday ... by Thursday no response ... Over 48 hours now and still waiting."
     - Customer (1-star, 4 Jun 2025): "Submitted at 8am ... 9pm and we've had no contact."
   - **Configurable?** Yes—practices control triage/response times and call protocols. System allows messaging, but practices may close requests prematurely.

#### 4. **Equity and Exclusion of Vulnerable Groups** (Mentioned in ~40% of reviews)
   PATCHS assumes digital literacy, smartphones, email, and English proficiency, excluding elderly, non-English speakers, those without tech, or with disabilities. Geo-blocks and mobile verification add barriers.

   - **Frequency Breakdown:** 50% of 1-star, 30% of 2-star, 20% of 3-star.
   - **Examples:**
     - Guest Michael Fox (2-star, 15 Feb 2024): "Totally useless if you do not have a mobile phone ... A waste of time for those who are elderly."
     - Anne (3-star, 13 Sept 2024): "Geo-block inappropriate ... non-UK resident immediate family members of elderly dementia patients."
     - Amelia Whately-Smith (3-star, 23 Feb 2024): "Eritrean friends ... struggle with English and would find it far easier to write in Tigranya."
     - IR (1-star, 15 Aug 2025): "Very few people in the surgery can use it ... without a smartphone or email ... We’re not in Silicon Valley, we’re in Tottenham."
     - Ian Clark (1-star, 27 Jun 2025): "I am a 76 year old with Parkinson's ... spent 2 hours reading instructions ... frustration."
     - Fezile (3-star, 30 Jan 2024): "Not good for the elderly ... very tricky ... not compassionate."
   - **Configurable?** Partially—practices can offer alternatives (e.g., phone triage), but language/geo features are system-level.

#### 5. **Poor Integration and Triage Mismanagement** (Mentioned in ~35% of reviews)
   AI/triage misinterprets symptoms, leading to inappropriate advice or closures. Practices control PATCHS poorly, e.g., reception overriding or ignoring requests.

   - **Frequency Breakdown:** 40% of 1-star, 40% of 2-star, 25% of 3-star.
   - **Examples:**
     - Bobbo (2-star, 5 Feb 2025): "They immediately close all requests ... reception staff have total control ... open to abuse."
     - Geoff Gunby (3-star, 2 Jul 2025): "Wanted consultation about a physical problem but ... offered treatment for anxiety."
     - Joshua J (2-star, 19 Nov 2024): "Does not tell you your test results ... no visible interactive messaging ... not a one stop integrated service."
     - Kim (1-star, 6 Aug 2025): "Awful circular ridiculous bot chat ... didn’t address my issue correctly."
     - Andrei (1-star, 7 Apr 2024): "16 steps and 10 minutes ... unclear if this was how to book an appointment ... breach of GDPR."
   - **Configurable?** Highly—practices set triage questions, integration with records, and response workflows.

#### 6. **Non-System-Linked Suggestions from Reviews** (Mentioned in ~30% of reviews)
   These are broader frustrations not directly tied to PATCHS but impacting access, often suggesting hybrids or alternatives.
   - Prefer phone/human interaction (e.g., Wireblues, 3-star: "Prefer speaking ... not AI").
   - Increase staffing/reception hours (e.g., Shak, 3-star: "Ring them ... spent almost 2hrs ... focus on basics").
   - Allow multi-issue submissions (e.g., David Brennan, 3-star: "Add more than one condition").
   - Reintroduce walk-ins/home visits (e.g., Suzanne O'Brien, 1-star: "Doctors used to do home visits").
   - Better phone fallbacks (e.g., Lamine Mounssi, 3-star: "Always ask you to call the GP ... number 50 on the queue").

### Recommendations for Your Practice
To maximize PATCHS success and minimize access issues:
- **Extend Availability:** Configure for 24/7 submissions with queuing for non-urgent requests. Avoid strict daily limits; use auto-triage to prioritize.
- **Simplify Usability:** Customize forms to reduce mandatory questions, allow short answers, and extend timeouts. Test for mobile/browser compatibility.
- **Improve Responses:** Set multiple call attempts, preferred contact methods/numbers, and keep requests open for replies. Integrate better with patient records to avoid mis-triage.
- **Enhance Equity:** Offer phone/email alternatives prominently; support non-English languages; remove geo-blocks for carers; provide in-person setup help for elderly/tech-challenged.
- **Monitor Integration:** Train staff on triage; audit closures; link PATCHS fully with test results/appointments for "one-stop" access.
- **Hybrid Model:** Retain robust phone lines; allow direct bookings for follow-ups; pilot feedback surveys post-submission.
- **Testing and Feedback:** Before full rollout, user-test with diverse patients (e.g., elderly, workers). Monitor Trustpilot/Google reviews for ongoing tweaks.

This setup could turn PATCHS into an improvement over your current system, but emphasize patient choice to avoid perceptions of "barriers." If needed, I can refine this based on more details about your practice.
