absolute rubbish, people will lose the will to live before making any sense of this.

Worst thing to happen to the NHS, get rid of this nonsense. Poorly developed, crashes often, and unfair on the older generation to make them use such a technically confusing site!

Their front end appears to be developed by back end devs.
I have a degree in design and can confidently say that the service could be used as a case study for bad design.

They are an AI company historically, so they seem overly fond of the chat box layout. When requesting a repeat prescription the AI would want to direct me to other sites for support instead of contacting the GP. It's a repeat prescription. Just pass it on to the doctor.

The fact that on numerous occasions I have been directed by staff to ignore the questions and put all my information in the first box for the GP to read highlights that the issue is known.

The UI/UX is so poor that to list all the mistakes and provide corrections would qualify as a week of work.

I hope that they hire a design consultancy to rework the system with a focus on the user journey map.

If I could give it minus 10 I would; a 10-year-old high school student could do better than this; usability 0, feedback 0, interface 0. Can't find anything positive to say about it

Absolute rubbish

This is an awful system to keep patients from their GPs. Practices who use it should stop wasting  their (our) money.

Does not work and I am being denied access to my GP as Glenroyd Medical in Blackpool insists Patchs is used by even if patient cannot access the app.

User interface is terrible, still not sure whether the request has actually been submitted as a result and the timer for something that asks near un-ending and often irrelevant questions is pointless. I've worked with computers my whole … More

The use of AI or bots in health services, is just going to deny people access to services at the point of their greatest need. If the NHS thinks this is a way of repairing the service they are gravely mistaken, its just going to grow the … More

Patches is ill. It regularly crashes while I'm using it, and sometimes once I've completed a request it simply disappears and never creates a message. This usually means if I try again it won't work, so I will have to wait until the next day. Some days I'm lucky. Needs further work to make it more reliable as it's wasting everyone's time, having to do everything a number of times. It  needs diagnosing and mending

Appalling system. So long winded while they ask stupid irrelevent questions that more often than not you are timed out. Even though you put info in I don't think anyone actually reads it eg photographs - explained why I could not take a photo & was then asked to submit one. Wanted to change my appt - couldn't find anywhere to do it - just kept being told I had an appt. Multiple messages the exact same. Did the people who invented this system know anything about writing programmes?

My GP shared my personal/medical details with this company ( Advanced Health & Care) without my consent. They refused to respond to a SAR.

Received exact same text message from Patchs 6 times. Surely this system can't be trusted.
