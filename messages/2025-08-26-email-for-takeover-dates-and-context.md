## Email Enquiry for Takeover Dates and Context

Subject: *Request for information: GP Practice Management (PPG background research)*

Hello,

As a patient and member of the PPG at New Bank Health Centre, I’m preparing for our next meeting on September 10th and would like to clarify some background information about GTD Healthcare’s management of GP practices. Could you please confirm the following:

1. Management Tenure
   – The dates (year and month, if available) when GTD Healthcare formally assumed responsibility for each of your GP practices (e.g. New Bank Health Centre transferred April 2025).

2. Continuity of Staff
   – At each practice handover, whether core administrative/reception staff remained in post, or if significant staffing changes were made at the time.

3. Patient Feedback Handling
   – Whether GTD has an internal process for collecting and reviewing online patient feedback (e.g. Google reviews, NHS website feedback), and if/how this is used in practice improvement.

4. Practice Performance Transparency
   – Whether GTD routinely shares patient satisfaction data (beyond CQC reports) with patients or the public, and if so where this can be accessed. 
   – I found your one-page flyer titled “You said, we did (May 19)” (link in footnotes). It appears to date from before 2022 at least (according to the PDF metadata), but it wasn’t explicitly dated, and I haven’t been able to find any more recent reports in this style. Could you confirm whether updated versions exist, and the timescale that content related to?

5. Patient Access Standards
   – Does GTD have a standard policy or minimum expectation for patient access (e.g. typical wait time targets for routine or urgent appointments), and is this applied across all your GP practices?

A short reply covering the above points would be very helpful. It doesn’t need to be exhaustive if some information is sensitive or hard to collate; I’m simply hoping to fill in some background gaps ahead of the PPG meeting.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Robert Davies
Patient and member of PPG at New Bank Health Centre
