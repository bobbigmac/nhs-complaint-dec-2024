# GP online hours practice

#### You:
My doctor went and launched their new platform PATCHS, and it goes offline when their office is closed, which seems stupid to me. How common is this in UK gp's and are there literally any other businesses where this is normal practice for the website to be down when the office is closed? It's basically unimaginable to me as a systems engineer that anyone would think that's fine.

Short answer: you’re not crazy—this “closed form” behaviour is (a) common in UK general practice, (b) usually a settings choice in tools like PATCHS/eConsult/Accurx, and (c) unlike most other industries where websites stay up 24/7 and just promise next-business-day responses.

Here’s the useful detail:

- # How common is it?
  Very. Most GP practices using online-consultation tools set them to accept requests only in “core hours” and/or to shut when daily capacity is reached. The vendors explicitly support this: PATCHS shows “practice unavailable” if it’s outside hours or capacity is full; eConsult lets practices choose “working hours only” or to snooze until next day; Accurx lets surgeries set opening times and temporarily suspend forms. citeturn0search4turn0search8turn0search12turn0search3turn0search2turn0search10

- # New rule (important & recent)
  From **1 October 2025**, **all** practices in England must keep an online-consultation tool **open during core hours (8:00–18:30, Mon–Fri)**—at least for **non-urgent requests, medication queries and admin**. If your PATCHS is routinely “offline” during those hours, that’s now out of step with national requirements. citeturn0search5turn0search9

- # Why do they do it at all?
  Safety & workload management. If a practice accepts a request out of hours, someone must monitor/triage it safely; most tools warn patients that online forms aren’t for urgent issues and may not be seen until working days, and they signpost to **NHS 111** when the practice is closed. citeturn0search6turn0search8turn0search16

- # Is this normal outside healthcare?
  Not really. Most businesses keep their sites/forms open 24/7 and meet requests with next-working-day SLAs. What *is* common elsewhere is closing **live** services (phones, webchat, same-day delivery windows) out of hours—but the form itself usually remains open. (Healthcare is an outlier because of clinical risk and NHS rules about urgent care hand-offs.)

- # What you can push for (pragmatic asks)
  1. Keep PATCHS **open all core hours** for at least non-urgent/admin (now required). 2) If they cap “clinical” requests, keep an **admin/non-urgent** route open with clear messaging. Accurx/eConsult support this pattern, and PATCHS shows opening-hours and closed reasons—so it’s technically feasible to communicate availability without the site feeling “down.” citeturn0search2turn0search3turn0search12turn0search4

If you want, I can draft a tight 1-pager you can send to the practice manager citing the new core-hours requirement and asking them to adjust their PATCHS configuration accordingly.

Yeah, it feels bonkers. You shouldn’t have to play “beat the form” between meetings.

Here’s the practical way through it (and some leverage):

- **They’re now supposed to keep online requests open 8:00–18:30, Mon–Fri.** From **1 Oct 2025**, every GP practice in England must keep an online-consultation tool open during **core hours** (at least for non-urgent/routine requests, meds queries and admin). If PATCHS is routinely “closed” in those hours, that’s out of step with national rules. citeturn0search0turn0search5turn0search9turn0search16

- **Vendors deliberately allow closures/caps—your practice chose that config.** PATCHS shows “practice unavailable” outside hours or when daily capacity is hit; Accurx/eConsult also let practices set opening times and suspend forms. (So it’s not “the system is down”, it’s a switch they’ve flipped.) citeturn0search1turn0search12turn0search7turn0search3

- **What to do if you work 9–5:**
  1. **Submit during core hours from your phone** (it’s a 2–3-min form if you’ve created an account). In your text, add: “I can’t take calls 09:00–17:30—please SMS/PATCHS message; I’m available before 9, at lunch, or after 17:30.”
  2. **Ask specifically for an “Enhanced Access” slot** (evenings & Saturdays run by your PCN). Practices can book these for you; in many areas 111 can, too. Typical hours: **weekday 18:30–20:00 and Saturdays 09:00–17:00**. citeturn1search0turn1search2turn1search6
  3. If they’re closing the medical form early for capacity, **ask them to keep an “admin/non-urgent” route open** with clear messaging (Accurx explicitly supports keeping certain forms open outside set times). citeturn0search8

- **Two-paragraph note you can paste to the practice manager:**\
  *Subject: PATCHS availability during core hours*\
  “Hi, could you confirm PATCHS is open 08:00–18:30 Mon–Fri for non-urgent requests? NHS England requires online consultation tools to be available throughout core hours from **1 Oct 2025** for routine requests/medication/admin. Lately I’ve found the form closed during the day / at capacity. Please could you adjust the configuration and keep an admin route open with clear messaging? Thanks.” citeturn0search0turn0search5

If you want, tell me your practice name and I’ll check what they advertise for PATCHS hours and how to access your local evening/weekend hub so you’ve got exact wording and numbers.


#### You:
No. I'm saying this is completely unacceptable for patients. "Sneak a minute or two in your phone in work hours, even if that could get you sacked" is completely unacceptable. Insulting even for you to suggest it. Why is the expectation so fucking low? Is this like bare legal minimum or what? How common is it in numbers?

You’re right—and I’m sorry for suggesting you “grab a minute at work.” That was tone-deaf.

Here’s the straight answer you asked for.

# What’s the *minimum* now?

- **Since 1 Oct 2025**, every GP practice in **England** must keep an online-request tool **open during core hours (08:00–18:30, Mon–Fri)**—at least for **non-urgent appointment requests, medication queries and admin**. Turning it off in core hours is only allowed in **exceptional circumstances** with **ICB approval**. citeturn1search5turn1search0turn1search11

# How common is it, in numbers?

- England has about **6,229** GP practices (July 2025). citeturn3search0
- In **Sept 2025**, **6,032 practices** were known to have an online-consultation system, and **5,799** actually received submissions that month. So the new “keep it open in core hours” rule now applies to **almost all practices**. citeturn6view0
- **Before** Oct 2025: shutting forms outside opening hours (and sometimes when daily capacity was hit) was **very common**, but **there’s no official national % published**. What we *do* have are:
  - Vendor manuals showing practices can (and routinely do) **switch forms off** outside hours or when slots are full (PATCHS/eConsult/Accurx). citeturn0search1turn0search2turn0search8
  - Multiple practice websites stating **“online consultations 8:00–18:30 only”** (typical examples using eConsult). citeturn0search7turn0search17turn0search12
  - Healthwatch reports noting **“many practices” limit online access to opening hours or close forms early** to manage volume. citeturn8search1

# Why did this happen at all?

Historically it was justified as **safety/workload control**: if a form arrives out of hours, someone must monitor it or the system must **deflect to NHS 111**. That’s why tools show “practice unavailable” and signpost to 111 when closed. The **new contract** raises the bar so patients don’t have to “beat the form” during the working day. citeturn0search11turn1search5

If your practice’s PATCHS is still **shut in core hours**, that’s now against national requirements—cite the NHS England rule and the “exceptional circumstances with ICB approval” line when you complain. citeturn1search5turn1search11

It's only shut in office hours when it's broken, it's otherwise up during working hours, but I'm saying that's not good enough. I'm saying that's fucking stupid, from the patient's perspective. The entire point of a website is to remove the time restrictive element of communication.

You’re not wrong. A “website that shuts when the office shuts” defeats the whole point of the web. And no—outside healthcare you’d almost never see that for simple intake.

Here’s the reality (and what “good” should look like):

- **Current rule = only core hours.** Since 1 Oct 2025, NHS England requires practices to keep an online-request tool **open 08:00–18:30 Mon–Fri** (at least for **non-urgent, medication, admin**). It does **not** require 24/7 intake—so many surgeries still shut outside core hours. citeturn4view0
- **But 24/7 is technically supported.** eConsult lets practices accept forms *24/7 by default* (they can choose to restrict it). Accurx’s own template says online requests are “**available 24/7**.” So shutting the form is a **choice**, not a hard technical limit. citeturn5view0turn9view0
- **Admin can be 24/7 even where clinical is capped.** Accurx’s patient FAQ shows **admin requests can be available 24×7 without limit**—which is exactly what many patients need outside work hours. Your own practice’s FAQ also says **admin queries can be submitted 24/7**. citeturn7view0turn3view0
- **Patients hate the narrow windows.** Healthwatch found lots of users blocked by forms that shut outside 9–5 or after daily caps; many explicitly asked for **24/7 submission with next-day triage**. citeturn12view0
- **When it’s “down in hours,” that’s on the supplier or setup.** Vendors have public status pages and outage playbooks; practices can embed those links and publish fallbacks so patients aren’t stranded. citeturn1search0turn1search1turn13view0

### What ‘good’ looks like (patient-first)

1. **Keep intake open 24/7** for *admin and routine* requests; warn clearly that **urgent issues = 111/999**, and that **triage starts next working day**. (This is supported by supplier settings.) citeturn5view0turn9view0
2. **If they must cap clinical submissions**, keep an **admin/non-urgent route open 24/7** (Accurx supports this explicitly). citeturn7view0
3. **Publish response SLAs** (“we’ll acknowledge same day in core hours, next working day otherwise”). NHS England guidance supports setting clear expectations. citeturn4view0
4. **Show live system status + fallbacks** on the website (vendor status page links; what to do during an outage), so “it’s broken” doesn’t equal “no access”. citeturn1search0turn1search1turn13view0
5. **Offer evening/Saturday appointments** via PCN Enhanced Access for people who can’t talk 9–5. citeturn0search4

### If you want to push this locally

Copy/paste this (short and firm):

> **Subject: Keep online requests open 24/7 (with safe triage)**
>
> Hi, could you keep our online request system open 24/7 for **admin and routine** queries, with clear “not for urgent problems—use 111/999” messaging and next-working-day triage? NHS England only mandates core-hours availability, but vendors support 24/7 intake (eConsult default; Accurx policy says “available 24/7”). Your own FAQ already says **admin queries can be submitted 24/7**. When the system is down in hours, please surface the vendor **status page** and a published fallback so patients aren’t blocked. Thanks.

Sources for the exact points above if they push back: NHS England’s core-hours requirement (not 24/7) and wording on managing urgent risk; eConsult’s 24/7 default setting; Accurx’s 24/7 language and 24×7 admin route; PATCHS pages explaining “practice unavailable” is a configuration choice; your practice FAQ stating admin can be sent 24/7; vendor status/outage guidance. citeturn4view0turn5view0turn9view0turn7view0turn8view0turn3view0turn1search0turn1search1turn13view0

Bottom line: your expectation (24/7 intake with next-business-day handling) is normal for the web and **entirely achievable** with the current GP tech stack. The current policy sets the floor (core hours); it doesn’t stop practices from meeting a higher bar for patients who work.


#### You:
Why is the standard so fucking low? Patients can spend months or even years sick even before they can try and request an appointment, and then be stuck in triage even longer if they're not available to receive unscheduled phone calls during the day, starting over from scratch. How do I get my practice to do better than this? I'm already in the PPG and they make the right noises but have so far been ineffective in actually making positive change

You’re right to be angry. A “website that shuts when you’re not at work” is hostile to patients. The bar is low because the system has optimised for **managing risk and workload**, not for patient convenience—and until very recently the national rules didn’t demand better.

**Why it’s like this (in one screen):**

- Contracts historically allowed practices to **switch forms off out of hours** to concentrate staff in core hours; that became custom and culture. citeturn0search0
- The 2025/26 contract only **guarantees core-hours online access** (08:00–18:30, Mon–Fri) for non-urgent/meds/admin—not 24/7. Many practices stop there. citeturn0search1turn0search2
- Data and targets skew to what’s easy to count (appointment books), so the pain of blocked forms and missed callbacks is under-measured. citeturn4search16

That said, your practice **can** do much better *without* breaking safety rules. Here’s a tight, PPG-friendly plan that gets traction.

# 90-day PPG action plan (concrete, measurable)

**Set the bar:** ask partners to adopt these 6 commitments (and publish them on the website).

1. **Online requests open 100% of core hours** (contractual minimum) **plus 24/7 for admin** (with next-working-day triage + clear 111/999 signposting). citeturn0search1turn0search2
2. **No “phone-tag” triage.** Patients choose contact method/time window; default to written replies where safe. (PATCHS/Accurx both support two-way messaging and templates.) citeturn1search8turn1search16
3. **Offer bookable call/visit times** (use Accurx **Self-Book** so patients pick a slot that fits work/life). citeturn1search13
4. **Evening/Saturday choice** via PCN **Enhanced Access**; make sure staff can book these directly. citeturn0search3
5. **Publish response SLAs** (e.g., acknowledge within same day in hours / by next working day otherwise) and display the **Patient Charter** on the site (now required). citeturn2search11turn2search10
6. **Outage fallback:** when PATCHS is down, show a clear banner with what to do and keep an admin route available (don’t leave patients stranded). (NHSE comms guidance backs proactive updates.) citeturn3search7

**Make it operational (what to switch on):**

- In PATCHS: keep **clinical** requests on during core hours; keep **non-clinical/admin** available 24/7; use **custom questions** to capture “best contact times” and **two-way messaging** for written replies; use **Booked slots** to spread work. citeturn4search3turn4search8turn4search0turn4search11turn4search1
- In Accurx: use **Scheduled messages**, **appointment reminders** (with time windows), and **Self-Book** so patients aren’t waiting for random calls. citeturn1search1turn1search21turn1search13
- If you (or others) have a disability or communication need, insist they record it under the **Accessible Information Standard** and make the corresponding **reasonable adjustments** (e.g., “no phone calls; email/SMS only” or “pre-booked call windows”). That isn’t optional. citeturn3search0turn3search2turn3search14

**Measure and publish (so it doesn’t slide):**

- % of days the form is **open all core hours**;
- **Median and 95th-percentile** time to first response;
- % requests resolved **asynchronously** (no call needed);
- % of calls **successfully scheduled** vs. failed callbacks;
- # of **Enhanced Access** bookings per week.

Put the graph on the practice website and review at every PPG. (Contract and patient-charter changes expect this transparency.) citeturn0search1turn2search11

**Escalation levers (if talk doesn’t move the dial):**

- Quote the contract change: online tools **must** be open throughout core hours for non-urgent/meds/admin from **1 Oct 2025**. Raise persistent breaches with the **ICB primary care team**; CQC also looks at access arrangements. citeturn0search1turn0search2turn0search8

# Copy-paste motion for your next PPG meeting

> **Motion: Patient-centred access package (within 90 days)**\
> The practice will: (1) keep clinical online requests open all core hours and admin requests 24/7 with next-working-day triage; (2) collect contact-time preferences and default to written replies where safe; (3) offer bookable telephone/face-to-face slots including evenings/Saturdays via Enhanced Access; (4) publish response SLAs and monthly access metrics; (5) display the NHS “**You and Your General Practice**” charter prominently; (6) maintain a clear outage banner with fallback routes. Implementation will use existing vendor features (PATCHS/Accurx). citeturn0search3turn2search11

If you want, I’ll turn this into a one-page “change pack” with the exact PATCHS/Accurx settings and a simple dashboard template you can hand to the practice manager.

Short version: GTD looks like a *very* low-margin, “not-for-profit / social-enterprise” group that basically breaks even most years. There isn’t a big pile of profit sitting there.

### What the latest accounts say

- **Group (GTD Healthcare Ltd – consolidated)** FY2024\
  Turnover **£49.28m**, profit after tax **£8,267** → **\~0.017% margin**. FY2023 profit was **£124k** on **£47.40m** (\~0.26% margin). Cash at year-end **£2.35m**; net assets (reserves) **£2.04m**. Staff costs **£20.80m** with an average **1,140 employees**. Highest-paid director **£135,078**; total directors’ pay **£516,639**. citeturn5view2turn5view8turn21view2turn21view3

- **Operating company (GoToDoc Ltd)** FY2024\
  Turnover **£44.55m**, surplus after tax **£505k** → **\~1.13% margin**. (Company limited by guarantee, so surpluses are reinvested.) citeturn10view2

- **Property holdco (GTD Health Holdings Ltd)**\
  Small company accounts; owns practice premises; says it **broke even** and expects to do so again. citeturn13view3turn13view4

- The group’s own report leans on a **“not-for-profit / social-enterprise ethos”** and says workforce pay is the biggest cost driver. citeturn4view3turn4view4

### What that means in practice

- This is a big provider with **razor-thin headroom**. Group cash ≈ **17 days of turnover**, which is tight for a service business. That often pushes organisations to run **to the contract spec** and be risk-averse about anything that adds unfunded demand (e.g., leaving online clinical requests open 24/7). citeturn5view8

- New Bank specifically: GTD is now the operator and has introduced **PATCHS**. Their own FAQ says **clinical requests are only accepted during opening hours**, though **admin requests can be sent 24/7**—which matches PATCHS’s documented behaviour when a practice is “closed”. citeturn18view0turn19search13turn19search7

### So why does it feel like “bare minimum”?

Likely because (a) **funding is largely fixed** per contract while demand is elastic; (b) **digital requests create extra work** if left open out-of-hours with no funded triage capacity waiting in the morning; and (c) **tiny margins** + limited reserves make them prioritise throughput/stability over patient-friendly extras. That’s an inference from the accounts and PATCHS config, not an inside view.

### If you want better locally (PPG hat on)

- Ask for **clear, published PATCHS hours** (clinical vs admin), **daily request caps**, and the **overflow plan** (e.g., an alternate non-clinical form when PATCHS is off). Their own leaflet says admin can be 24/7—push to keep that live and visible. citeturn19search13turn19search19
- Request **access KPIs** posted monthly: request volumes, first-response times, call wait times, and DNA/cancellation data. (They already measure most of this for commissioners.)
- Escalate through the **ICB** if needed: FOI the **APMS contract KPIs** and expected digital access standards for New Bank. The practice site confirms GTD holds a 10–15-year contract—so commissioners should be expecting steady improvements. citeturn18view0

If you want, I can draft a one-page PPG brief that cites these numbers and asks for specific changes (hours, overflow, KPIs, and timelines).

Well that's fucking shit innit. You're telling me the best I can expect is worse than on their old system cos at least that had out of hours submission.

It’s on the canvas to your right.

If you want, I can tailor it with your practice’s names/links and turn it into a one-pager PDF for the meeting.


#### You:

#### ChatGPT:
You’re right: adding “extra steps” is the opposite of what patients need. Let’s aim higher and *simpler*. Here’s a **zero-faff model** you can demand—no hoops, no phone-tag, no “start again”.

# The bar you should set (plain, non-negotiable)

1. **Single front door, always open (24/7).** One short form: **name + DOB + “what do you need?” + contact preference**. Auto-acknowledge with a **ticket ID**. Everything else (category, clinician type, admin vs clinical) is the practice’s job to triage—**not the patient’s**.

2. **No unscheduled calls. Ever.** If a call is needed, the practice must **send a booking link** for a same/next-day **call window** (e.g., 12:00–12:30 or 18:30–19:00). Otherwise default to **asynchronous message/SMS**. If the patient can’t go online, reception books the window for them.

3. **Never “start over” rule.** If the practice misses you, they **own the follow-up**: they message you with a new booking link. The ticket stays open **14 days**—no re-submitting the form, no re-explaining your problem.

4. **24-hour first-human-response pledge.** Immediate auto-receipt; **human reply within 1 working day** for routine/admin (and same-day for urgent-rated by the practice). If they miss that, it **auto-escalates** to a named lead.

5. **Continuity and tracking.** Every reply carries the **same ticket ID**; you can **add info/reply** by answering the text or portal message—no duplication.

6. **Outage = fallback, not a wall.** If the platform breaks, the website shows a **live banner** plus a **simple fallback form** (or SMS keyword) that opens a ticket with the same rules. Patients aren’t stranded.

7. **Accessibility is honoured, not “noted”.** Communication preferences (no daytime calls, email only, interpreter, carer contact) are **stored and enforced** on every ticket.

# “That’s nice, but can they actually do it?”

Yes—**without** new funding or new software:

- Keep **one short request route** open 24/7 (use the vendor’s simplest template; hide the categories; add “contact preference” + “best time”).
- Turn on **two-way messaging** and **self-book links** for call windows.
- Set up **ticket IDs** (vendors generate these) and train staff to keep one thread open until resolution.
- Publish **two numbers** monthly: % tickets with **first human reply ≤1 working day** and **% calls that were scheduled**, plus a single **status banner** that flips to fallback when the system’s down.

# The push: five lines to table at PPG

> **Motion – Zero-Faff Access (8-week pilot):**\
> (1) One always-open short form (24/7) creating a ticket ID;\
> (2) No unscheduled calls—patients pick a call window or get written replies;\
> (3) “Never start over” rule—missed contact = we re-schedule on the same ticket;\
> (4) First human response ≤1 working day (routine/admin) or same day (urgent);\
> (5) Live outage banner with a working fallback form/SMS.\
> We will publish (% ≤1-day replies, % scheduled calls) monthly.

# If they argue “capacity” or “safety”, here’s the counter

- **Capacity:** keep intake open; **throttle *when you work on it*, not whether patients can ask**. Queues are your internal problem; closed doors are the patient’s problem.
- **Safety:** urgent signposting stays on the page; the practice still triages the queue early AM. Out-of-hours submission ≠ out-of-hours triage.
- **Complexity:** fewer fields, one place to check, one ticket per problem → *less* work than hunting across phones, emails, and multiple forms.

If you want, I’ll rewrite the pack into a **one-page “Zero-Faff Access” charter** (no extras, just those seven rules + the five-line motion) that you can put in front of the partners for a simple **yes/no**.


#### You:
I really need to make the case here that this is what systemic failure looks like. Doctors should be able to do better than the bare minimum.

#### ChatGPT:
You’re right: what you’re describing **is** systemic failure—rules and incentives that make “bare minimum” feel normal. Here’s a tight case you can put in front of the partners and the PPG that’s hard to swat away.

# What systemic failure looks like (in GP access)

- **Forms that shut** or break, forcing patients into the 8–6:30 window and random callbacks. The current national rule only **guarantees core-hours online access**, not 24/7 intake—so many providers stop at the floor, not the ceiling. citeturn4search0turn4search1
- **Patients carry the admin burden** (re-submitting, repeating histories, waiting for unscheduled calls). Healthwatch reports show people are blocked by closed forms, unclear wording, and triage that isn’t explained. That’s harm by design, not “user error”. citeturn4search2turn4search8
- **“Unavailable” is a config choice.** PATCHS/eConsult allow switching off outside hours or when daily caps are hit—so the door closes exactly when working people need it. citeturn4search7turn4search13

# Why doctors should (and can) do better than the minimum

- **Policy sets a floor, not a ceiling.** From **1 Oct 2025** practices must keep online requests open in **core hours** for non-urgent, meds and admin. Nothing stops them keeping **admin 24/7** with next-working-day triage. Meeting the floor is compliance; exceeding it is care. citeturn4search0turn4search1
- **Regulators expect equitable access.** CQC’s quality statements include **“Equity in access”**—people should get care **when they need it**, not just when the switch is on. Closing the front door disproportionately harms disabled people, shift-workers and carers. citeturn4search9
- **Equality duties are real.** The **Accessible Information Standard** requires recording and **honouring communication needs** (e.g., “no daytime calls; SMS/email only”)—that’s not a courtesy; it’s required practice. citeturn4search4turn4search18

# The ask (simple, patient-first, doable now)

**1) One front door, 24/7—for admin & routine.** Short form (name, DOB, “what do you need?”, contact preference). Promise: *acknowledge instantly, human reply by next working day*. Clinical requests can still be **worked** in core hours. citeturn4search1\
**2) No unscheduled calls.** If a call’s needed, send a **self-book link** for a same/next-day window. Default to written replies where safe (two-way messaging).\
**3) Never “start again”.** One ticket/thread per problem for 14 days; missed contacts trigger a new **bookable** slot—patients don’t re-submit.\
**4) Outage ≠ lockout.** Website shows a live banner and a **fallback form/SMS** that creates the same ticket when PATCHS is down. citeturn4search7\
**5) Publish two numbers monthly** (so it sticks): **% with first human reply ≤1 working day** (routine/admin) and **% calls that were scheduled** (not random).\
**6) Use the capacity you already have.** Point patients who can’t do 9–5 to **Enhanced Access** evenings/Saturdays—make these bookable by link. citeturn4search5turn4search11

# 60-second script for your PPG/partners

> *“Policy now requires online access in core hours. Patients need more than the floor. CQC expects equity, and the Accessible Information Standard means we must meet communication needs. Let’s run an 8-week **Zero-Faff Access** pilot: a 24/7 admin/routine front door; no unscheduled calls; one ticket until resolution; an outage fallback; and two public KPIs. This reduces phone ping-pong, helps working patients, and stays within safety rules because triage still happens in core hours. Are we prepared to commit to this today?”* citeturn4search1turn4search9turn4search4

If you want, I’ll turn that into a one-page handout with the exact wording and the KPI graph template you can drop into the agenda pack.

#### You:
can you identify the exact settings in PATCHS that 'try' to solve my problems. I'd like to put these exact settings from their actual documentation as a set of recommendations to the team. Don't make assumptions or guess; there are documents online you can find and read to confirm what settings are available, as PATCHS publish their docs (such as they are). Address each problem one at a time, and then propose an exact solution where available that PATCHS already supports if enabled.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. Here’s a **point-by-point list of your problems** and the **exact PATCHS settings / admin pages** that (at least try to) address each one. I’ve kept this practical so you can lift the item, the setting name, and the doc link title straight into a recommendation for the team.

---

## 1) “The form is closed / ‘practice unavailable’ (out of hours, at capacity, or when it’s ‘broken’)”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Opening hours** shown to patients everywhere PATCHS mentions availability. *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Opening hours**. *Action:* set hours correctly (or widen them) and keep the text explicit (e.g., “Mon–Fri 08:00–18:30”). citeturn5search2
- **Custom ‘closed / limits reached’ messages** on the homepage. *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Creating custom home page messages for patients when PATCHS limits have been reached or PATCHS is closed**. *Action:* add a clear fallback (“call us”, “use NHS 111”, Enhanced Access times). citeturn6view0
- **Reason codes for ‘unavailable’** (outside normal hours, daily “PATCHS slots” filled, staff shortages, very busy). *Use this to audit why patients are blocked and reduce avoidable closures.* citeturn5search1
- **Principle on request limits** (PATCHS acknowledges 24/7 is ideal; if you do cap requests, don’t direct patients to PATCHS while it’s off). *Use as leverage to widen windows.* citeturn5search18

**Recommendation text you can use**

> Set **Opening hours** accurately and widen where safe; publish **custom closed/limits messages** with explicit fallbacks (phones, 111, Enhanced Access). Reduce ‘slots filled’ closures where possible and track the **unavailable reasons** weekly to fix root causes. citeturn5search2turn6view0turn5search1turn5search18

---

## 2) “Unscheduled daytime phone calls → missed calls → told to re-submit”

**What PATCHS supports**

- Ask patients **their preferred contact method** on every request. *Admin path:* Edit practice → Feature settings → **Preferred contact method question** (enable). Lets patients choose phone / SMS / email / in-person. citeturn7view0
- **Send as SMS / email (message in the body)** for “no-reply-required” comms so patients don’t have to open a portal link. *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Message Settings including ‘Send as SMS’ behaviour**. citeturn5search8
- **SMS or email** can be chosen per message (reduce dependency on a single channel). *See:* **Messaging FAQ – “Can PATCHS send messages by SMS and email?”** citeturn5search16

**Recommendation**

> Enable the **Preferred contact method question** and default to **asynchronous messaging** (use **Send as SMS/email**) wherever clinically safe, so patients aren’t forced into unscheduled calls. citeturn7view0turn5search8turn5search16

---

## 3) “No acknowledgement / not sure when to chase”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Patient request completion emails** (auto email when a request is completed). *Admin path:* Edit practice → Feature settings → **Patient request completion emails** (on). citeturn7view0
- **Set ‘waiting time before contacting the practice’** (shows patients when to chase if there’s no reply). *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Setting the patient waiting time before contacting the practice**. citeturn5search14
- **Unread message reminder settings** (automated nudges). *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Unread message reminder settings**. citeturn6view0
- **Message notifications** for staff (to stop messages sitting unseen). *Admin path:* **Message notifications** (enable + SSO). citeturn5search4

**Recommendation**

> Turn on **completion emails**, set a clear **waiting-time to chase**, enable **unread reminders**, and switch on **staff message notifications**. Publish this SLA in the opening message. citeturn7view0turn5search14turn6view0turn5search4

---

## 4) “Can’t schedule a specific time; everything is ad-hoc”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Booked slots** + safety rules (urgent ≤48h; emergency same-day; system won’t let you assign beyond those). This indicates a **booked-slot feature** that can be enabled and used safely. citeturn5search11
- **Automatically book PATCHS consults into the clinical system diary** (EMIS/TPP). *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Automatically Book Patchs Consults into Clinical System Appointment Diary**. citeturn6view0
- **Appointment reminders** (24h before, via PDS contact details; post-appointment messages optional). *Admin path:* **Appointment reminders and messages**. citeturn5search12

**Recommendation**

> Enable **Booked slots** and **Auto-booking to the appointment diary**, with **24-hour reminders**. Use booked callbacks instead of “we’ll ring sometime today”. citeturn5search11turn6view0turn5search12

---

## 5) “Patients can’t submit unless they have both an email and a phone”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Choose SMS or email** per message (don’t force both). *Messaging FAQ*. citeturn5search16
- **Guest accounts** exist (patients can submit without full registration). *See ‘Guest accounts’ in related articles under Request settings; enable where appropriate.* citeturn7view0

**Recommendation**

> Accept requests from **Guest accounts** where possible and communicate by **either** SMS **or** email (don’t require both). citeturn7view0turn5search16

---

## 6) “Long, duplicative forms; better to keep it short and iterate”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Template library & custom template builder**, including **question sets** and **questionnaires** you can send after the initial short request to gather just what you need. *Page:* **Managing and responding to a patient request** (see “Pick message template”). citeturn5search3

**Recommendation**

> Keep the initial form minimal; use **templated follow-up questionnaires** to collect detail asynchronously (no duplication, better UX). citeturn5search3

---

## 7) “Patients want to submit outside office hours (with safe signposting)”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Opening hours** text + **Patient signpost panels** (add 111/999 guidance everywhere it appears). *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Opening hours** + **Patient signpost panels**. citeturn5search2turn6view0
- **Principle**: 24/7 intake is ideal; if you limit requests, don’t send patients to PATCHS when it’s off. *Use to argue for 24/7 admin/routine intake with next-working-day triage.* citeturn5search18

**Recommendation**

> Keep **admin/routine requests open broader hours (ideally 24/7)** with clear signposting to 111/999 and **state triage timelines** in the opening text. citeturn5search2turn5search18

---

## 8) “Stuff ‘disappears’ or is ‘deleted’”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Patient and Request Removal** tooling is **auditable and reversible** by a PATCHS Admin; shows who removed/when. Use it to investigate any allegation. citeturn5search7

**Recommendation**

> Require the team to check the **Removal audit** before telling a patient to re-submit; restore if removed in error. citeturn5search7

---

## 9) “When PATCHS is ‘down’ mid-day, patients are stranded”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Login page message** + **Custom closed/limits messages** to display fallback channels during outages. *Admin path:* Patchs for Admins → **Login page message** + **Creating custom home page messages … closed/limits reached**. citeturn6view0

**Recommendation**

> Publish a **live fallback banner** (phones, walk-in rules, Enhanced Access) whenever the form is closed or failing. Keep it up-to-date. citeturn6view0

---

## 10) “Lower-cost, reliable comms beyond working hours”

**What PATCHS supports**

- **Send via NHS App messages** (individual or bulk; also for appointment reminders). *Admin path:* **Sending messages via NHS App**. citeturn5search21

**Recommendation**

> Use **NHS App messages** (where patients have it) to cut SMS costs and improve delivery/read rates for out-of-hours comms. citeturn5search21

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page checklist (with the exact admin paths) you can drop into the PPG pack.


#### You:
hmm, that's not what I asked for. I'm looking not for waffle, but for PATCHS settings that do fix my problems. Telling them to set correct opening hours is useless, because that doesn't solve the problem of the website being down for 2/3s of every day. Don't waffle, avoid jargon, stick to the point, and provide what I asked for.

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
Understood. Here are **only** PATCHS settings (with the exact names used in their docs) that directly fix the issues you described. Each item = **problem → setting to enable → why it helps** (with the doc title as a citation).

---

### 1) “I can’t submit requests outside office hours.”

**Fix:** **Request limiter → set to unlimited (24/7)**\
**Why:** PATCHS explicitly says the ideal is **unlimited and on 24/7**; using the limiter to close the form is optional. Disable limits so admin/routine requests can always be submitted and queued for next-day triage. citeturn8search10

---

### 2) “Random daytime callbacks; I need a scheduled time instead.”

**Fix A:** **Booked slots** (Edit practice → Feature settings → **Enable booked slots**)\
**Why:** Lets the practice assign requests to a **specific future time/day** for a named staff member, avoiding ad-hoc calls. citeturn8search7turn8search16\
**Fix B:** **Automatically Book PATCHS Consults into Clinical System Appointment Diary**\
**Why:** When a request is assigned, it **creates an appointment** in EMIS/TPP—so the callback has a slot in the diary (and you can add reminders). citeturn8search2

---

### 3) “I’m forced into phone calls; I want written replies (SMS/email).”

**Fix A:** **Request settings → Preferred contact method question (enable)**\
**Why:** Patients can state **SMS/email** so the team can respond asynchronously. citeturn8search1\
**Fix B:** **Messaging FAQ → Send messages by SMS or Email**\
**Why:** Staff can choose **SMS or email (or both)** per message—no need to phone unless clinically necessary. citeturn8search11

---

### 4) “Missed calls → told to start over.”

**Fix:** **Booked slots** + **Unread message reminders**\
**Why:** Use a **booked slot** for any needed call; if contact fails, keep the **same request/thread** and nudge the patient automatically with **Unread message reminder settings** (Edit practice → Feature settings → **Unread message reminders**). No re-submission. citeturn8search7turn8search3

---

### 5) “System goes down / caps hit and patients are stranded.”

**Fix A:** **Creating custom home page messages for patients when PATCHS limits have been reached or PATCHS is closed**\
**Why:** Show a **live fallback** (what to do now, e.g., phone, Enhanced Access) **on the PATCHS front page** when limits/closure kick in. citeturn8search4\
**Fix B:** **Login page message**\
**Why:** Put the same fallback on the **login page** so patients always see it during outages. citeturn8search21

---

### 6) “Booked times still get missed; I want confirmations to reduce no-shows.”

**Fix:** **Appointment reminders and messages**\
**Why:** Sends **24-hour reminders** for appointments in the clinical system (not just PATCHS-booked), reducing missed callbacks/visits. citeturn8search12

---

## Drop-in recommendation text (one line each)

- **Keep PATCHS always open:** “Set **Request limiter** to **unlimited (24/7)** so patients can submit anytime; triage next working day.” citeturn8search10
- **No ad-hoc calls:** “Enable **Booked slots** and **Automatically book into the clinical diary** for scheduled telephone/face-to-face.” citeturn8search7turn8search2
- **Asynchronous first:** “Enable **Preferred contact method** and use **SMS/Email** messaging by default.” citeturn8search1turn8search11
- **No ‘start again’:** “Use **Unread message reminders** to chase within the **same thread** instead of asking for re-submission.” citeturn8search3
- **Outage fallback visible:** “Configure **custom closed/limits messages** and a **login page message** with clear next steps.” citeturn8search4turn8search21
- **Reduce missed slots:** “Turn on **Appointment reminders and messages**.” citeturn8search12

If you want, I can condense this to a one-page checklist you can hand to the practice manager.
