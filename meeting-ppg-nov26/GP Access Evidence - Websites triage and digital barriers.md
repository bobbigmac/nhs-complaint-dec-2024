# GP Access Issues - Evidence Pack

Prepared as a working list of **Who is complaining** about GP access problems linked to online systems and triage. Sources are grouped by their **primary concern**:

- **A. GP websites / online tools closed out-of-hours or when capacity is reached**  
- **B. Mandatory phone-only triage or phone bottlenecks blocking access**  
- **C. Other access issues: digital exclusion, complexity, unsafe / low-standard models, or general access dissatisfaction**  

## Who is affected (rough scale)

England. Rates per 1,000 residents/households (approx).

| Group                              | Number          | Rate        | Why it matters                                    |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|------------:|---------------------------------------------------|
| All registered patients (England)  | ~56m            | 1000/1000   | Everyone hit by closures, form shut-offs, queues. |
| Long-term conditions               | ~26m            | ≈460/1000   | Need repeat contact; friction compounds.          |
| Disabled people                    | ~14m (of ~16m UK)| ≈250/1000  | Need accessible, multi-channel routes.            |
| Older people (65+)                 | ~11m            | ≈200/1000   | Higher need, lower digital confidence.            |
| Most deprived 20% areas            | ~11m            | ≈200/1000   | Less digital access, higher illness burden.       |
| Low/no essential digital skills    | ~10–11m (UK)    | ≈160–180/1000 | Web-only flows exclude many.                    |
| Offline households                 | ~1.5m (UK)      | ≈50/1000 hh | No web access at all.                             |
| Limited English proficiency        | ~0.9m (E&W)     | ≈15/1000    | Forms + phone triage much harder to use.          |

### 7. Cross-cutting summary by “interest”

* **Patient voice (local & national):** multiple independent Healthwatch bodies in Hertfordshire, Tower Hamlets, Ealing, Wandsworth, Westminster, Kent, plus Healthwatch England, all flagging digital front doors and booking systems as access barriers (A, B, C).
* **System implementers:** ICBs/ICSs and PCNs trialling online triage / digital front doors, documenting both gains and new exclusions (Herts & West Essex, West Kent, SW London).
* **Practices:** named surgeries showing how the new GP contract is realised as core-hours-only and capacity-capped online access, plus practice-level descriptions of phone scrambles (Oakwood Lane, Church Lane, Old Hill, St Luke’s, Donnington).
* **Policy & safety bodies:** NHS England, DHSC, BMA, LMCs, HSSIB shaping and contesting the low access floor and warning about workload and safety risks.
* **Democratic oversight & data:** local scrutiny committees, national surveys and polling, and performance trackers all pointing to GP access as a top public grievance and a system under strain (C).

## A. GP websites / online systems closed out-of-hours or when capacity is reached

### 1. Healthwatch Hertfordshire – Online GP websites & forms shut / limited

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Hertfordshire (with Healthwatch Essex / Herts & West Essex ICS)  
**Primary issue:** Online GP services frequently unavailable outside short time windows or closed when demand is high; people want **24/7 form submission** with responses in core hours.

### 2. Healthwatch Tower Hamlets – Online consultation systems closing when full

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Tower Hamlets  
**Primary issue:** High proportion of **negative feedback about online consultations** – forms are complex, confusing and **become unavailable once capacity is reached**, leaving people blocked.

### 3. Healthwatch Ealing – Limited online booking windows, poor online forms

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Ealing  
**Primary issue:** **Online forms and booking windows are restricted**, add friction, and frequently fail to resolve issues; patients complain about both online and phone routes for appointments.

### 4. Healthwatch Wandsworth – Websites and NHS App as barriers

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Wandsworth  
**Primary issue:** **Digital access routes (practice websites, online forms, NHS App)** are hard to use for many; recommends auditing websites against NHS England’s benchmarking tool and simplifying online access.

### 5. Healthwatch national – online consultations and websites blocking access

**Organisation:** Healthwatch England (national)  
**Primary issue:** Across England, **online consultations often don’t resolve problems** and people struggle to get through on the phone or book appointments; digital routes plus weak websites are repeatedly highlighted as barriers.

- **Q4 Patient Experience Report (national)** – includes GP online consultations as a key theme  
  - https://nds.healthwatch.co.uk/reports-library/q4-patient-experience-report-1

### 6. Individual practices – online access limited to core hours or capacity

**Primary issue:** Practice websites explicitly describe online tools as only available **in core hours** and/or **until capacity is reached**, illustrating how the new contract has locked in a low floor.

Representative examples we’ve already looked at:

- **Oakwood Lane Medical Practice (Leeds)** – *Availability of Online consultations from 1 October 2025*  
  Describes online consultation access as available during core hours (8:00–18:30) for non‑urgent requests, in line with contract – no 24/7 route.  
  - https://www.oakwoodlanemedical.nhs.uk/2025/10/07/availability-of-online-consultations-from-1-october-2025/

- **Church Lane Surgery – Changes to our online access from October 2025**  
  States that **online bookings open from 7:30am until capacity is reached each day**, so the digital front door is literally closed once slots run out.  
  - https://churchlanesurgery.co.uk/news/changes-to-our-online-access-from-october-2025-increasing-access-to-routine-care/

- **The Practice Old Hill – Changes to our online access from October 2025**  
  Explains that online consultation tools are open between 8am and 6:30pm for routine requests only, aligned exactly with the contract floor.  
  - https://thepracticeoldhill.co.uk/news/changes-to-our-online-access-from-october-2025-increasing-access-to-routine-care/

- **St Luke’s Health Centre – Changes to our online access from October 2025** (very similar wording to The Practice Old Hill)  
  - https://stlukeshealthcentre.nhs.uk/news/changes-to-our-online-access-from-october-2025-increasing-access-to-routine-care/

## B. Mandatory phone-only triage or phone bottlenecks blocking access

### 7. Healthwatch Ealing – “Call at 8am, everything gone”

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Ealing  
**Primary issue:** **Mandatory early-morning phone triage / booking**, with patients told to call at set times, then finding all slots gone once they finally get through.

- **Patient Experience Report Q4 2024–25**

### 8. Healthwatch national – phone access and booking still failing

**Organisation:** Healthwatch England  
**Primary issue:** In national synthesis, **people still struggle to get through on the phone** and face difficulties booking appointments, even as online tools expand.

- **Q4 Patient Experience Report (national)**  
  - https://nds.healthwatch.co.uk/reports-library/q4-patient-experience-report-1

### 9. Donnington Medical Practice – 8:30am phone scramble as explicit problem

**Organisation:** Donnington Medical Practice (Telford)  
**Primary issue:** Describes how total triage and limited capacity have produced an **8:30am phone scramble** with **300–400 calls before 9am**, leaving staff unable to help everyone and patients told there’s nothing left.

- **Online Consultations from 1st October 2025**  
  - https://www.donningtonmedicalpractice.co.uk/2025/09/30/online-consultations-from-1st-october-2025/

### 10. GP contract & government messaging – “ending the 8am scramble” (but only in core hours)

**Organisations:** NHS England, DHSC, BMA, LMCs  
**Primary issue:** Policy and commentary around the new GP contract acknowledge that current models create **telephone bottlenecks and 8am rushes**. Their solution is unlimited online requests during core hours, not 24/7 access, which still leaves people blocked outside those hours.

Key docs we’ve used:

- **NHS England – Changes to the GP Contract in 2025/26**  
  Official long-read; requires practices from 1 Oct 2025 to keep online consultation tools on **throughout core hours (8am–6:30pm)** for non‑urgent requests.

### 11. BMA dispute & safety concerns about unlimited online requests

**Organisation:** British Medical Association (GPC England)  
**Primary issue:** Argues that unlimited online requests during core hours, without agreed safeguards, will **overwhelm practices**, worsen safety, and risk shifting more triage work onto already stretched staff.

- **BMA FAQs for 1 October 2025 online consultations** (PDF)

## C. Other specific access issues (digital exclusion, complexity, unsafe / low standard models, general dissatisfaction)

### 12. Healthwatch Kent – ANIMA “digital front door” project

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Kent  
**Primary issue:** Evaluation of a **full digital front door (ANIMA)** across 4 practices: online becomes the main access route, but many patients find it complex, confusing or exclusionary; older and less digital patients are especially affected.

- **ANIMA – The Digital Front Door Project** (Jan 2025) – full report (PDF):  
  - https://nds.healthwatch.co.uk/sites/default/files/reports_library/20241217_Kent_ANIMA%20-%20THE%20DIGITAL%20FRONT%20DOOR%20PROJECT%20V7.0%20FINAL.pdf

### 13. Healthwatch Westminster / NW London – access to local primary care services

**Organisation:** Healthwatch Westminster (working across Brent, Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea)  
**Primary issue:** Residents report **complex, confusing access routes**, difficulties with digital tools and online triage systems, and desire for a **mix of online, phone and face‑to‑face** access.

- **What do patients think about access to local primary care services?** (27 Sept 2024)  
  - https://www.healthwatchwestminster.org.uk/blog/2024-09-27/what-do-patients-think-about-access-local-primary-care-services

### 14. Healthwatch Tower Hamlets, Ealing, Wandsworth – digital exclusion & complexity

**Organisations:** Healthwatch Tower Hamlets, Healthwatch Ealing, Healthwatch Wandsworth  
**Primary issue:** Across multiple boroughs, patients describe **online forms as long, repetitive and confusing**, not accessible to some disabled / older / non‑English‑speaking patients, and often not offering the options they need.

Representative reports (in addition to those listed above):

- **Healthwatch Tower Hamlets – Annual Report 2024–25**

### 15. HSSIB – digital tools for online consultation (safety risks)

**Organisation:** Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB)  
**Primary issue:** **Digital tools for online GP consultation carry patient safety risks**, including mis‑triage, missed serious illness and delays, and can put people off seeking help when online access is confusing or hard.

- **Patient safety investigation – Workforce and patient safety: digital tools for online consultation in general practice** (2024)  
  Full report:

  - https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/25/online-gp-consultations-have-led-to-harm-and-death-investigation-finds

### 16. Scrutiny committees – local councils examining GP access

**Organisations:** Various local authority overview & scrutiny committees  
**Primary issue:** Formal democratic bodies **investigating GP access problems** (including digital and triage models), often drawing on Healthwatch evidence and ICB data.

Key examples already in play:

- **Stockton-on-Tees Adult Social Care and Health Select Committee** – *Scrutiny Review of Access to GPs and Primary Medical Care*  
  Cabinet item and covering report (2024):  
  - https://moderngov.stockton.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=3304

  - https://www.barnet.gov.uk/search?search=Primary%20Care%20(GP)%20Access%20Task%20and%20Finish%20Group%20Report

- **Manchester City Council – Health Scrutiny Committee** – *Access to General Practice in Manchester*  
  Original GP access report and minutes:  
  - https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/documents/s25985/GP%20Access.pdf  
  - https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=142&MId=3737  
  - https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/documents/s26531/HSC%20Mins%208%20Sept.pdf

(Other councils – Leicestershire, Devon, Kent, Bury etc. – have similar access/scrutiny work, but the three above are the ones we’ve actually used so far.)

### 17. Primary care patient safety strategy (national context)

**Organisation:** NHS England  
**Primary issue:** Sets out commitments to **patient safety in primary care**, explicitly relevant to how digital access models and triage are implemented.

- **Primary care patient safety strategy** (Sept 2024)  
  - https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/primary-care-patient-safety-strategy/

### 18. General public anger and dissatisfaction about GP access

These sources aren’t specifically about websites or triage tools, but they show that **access to GP appointments is the top pressure point in the NHS**, and that current standards are widely seen as inadequate.

(These are drawn from our existing evidence pack on GP access and far‑right narratives.)

- **Ipsos polling (Sept 2025) – “Easier access to GP appointments remains public’s top priority for the NHS”**  
  - https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/easier-access-gp-appointments-remains-publics-top-priority-nhs

- **GP Patient Survey 2025 – official national stats on access and experience**  
  NHS England data and tools:  
  - https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhse-gp-patient-survey-results/2025  
  - https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gp-patient-survey-results-2025  
  - https://gp-patient.co.uk/latest-survey/results

- **Institute for Government – Performance Tracker Local: General practice in England** (Apr 2025)  
  Shows collapsed patient satisfaction with GP services, links higher satisfaction to more GPs and more face‑to‑face appointments.  
  - https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/performance-tracker-local/general-practice-england  
  - https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/2025-04/performance-tracker-local-gp-england_2.pdf

- **Healthwatch England polling via media – patients want a right to see GPs quickly**  
  (E.g. Guardian reporting May 2024 that patients want a right to see a GP within 24 hours enshrined.)  
  - https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/17/patients-england-want-right-to-see-gps-with-24-hours-enshrined-nhs-survey

- **Ipsos & YouGov data on GP access and wider NHS performance** – used in the immigration / far-right evidence pack, showing:  
  - High concern about NHS pressures and GP waits  
  - Strong belief that access is getting worse

(Full links for these are already captured in the separate “GP Access, Immigration Blame & Far‑Right Messaging — Evidence Pack”, which this document sits alongside.)

---

## How this pack is structured for use

- **Section A** gives you examples where patients and reports explicitly complain about **online GP systems being unavailable out-of-hours or when capacity is reached**.
- **Section B** lists sources where **phone-only triage / 8am phone bottlenecks** are clearly described as a problem, plus the national contract rules that entrench this model.
- **Section C** adds the wider context: **digital exclusion, complex or unsafe online tools, councils scrutinising access, and national data on how angry people are about GP access overall**.
